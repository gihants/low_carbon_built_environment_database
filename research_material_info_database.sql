This research aimed to draw attention to the importance of research methodologies and compared advantages and disadvantages of each method for calculation of different cost variables. This research reviewed only the mainstream methods for green cost-benefit predictions. The reviewed papers are inclusive of the most validated research works in the field, but not exclusive to quantitatively comparing the applications of different methods. A systematic quantitative literature review [46] is then recommended as future studies for further investigations and explorations of existing methods. Empirical experiences based on objective and subjective studies in real buildings have the benefit of experimental\r\ncontrols and internal validity of research design. However, the production of such detailed and accurate cost-benefit data is a demanding and time-consuming process. In addition, many contextual and non-contextual factors influence the cost-benefits of green buildings, which means the generalisation of findings based on a few building cost performances is not externally validated. Data collection from a secondary source, by being less time-consuming and demanding, have the benefit of larger sample collection possibilities and enhancing external validity. Yet, attention should be paid to data collections from reliable and trusted sources to avoid the production of false results. Accordingly, a balance between the validity of data sources and data sample sizes is necessary to minimize sampling errors and enable parametric statistical tests. It is then recommended that tools like BIDS [32], which is a tool based on the meta-analysis of several trusted and empirical studies, to be developed to accumulate the production of the large sample pool of validated database. The most common limitations and issues found in green cost-benefit literature could be summarised as: ? Restriction of database and case studies to the availability of data and reflecting only specific types of green buildings.\r\n? Lack of consistency in data collection methods. ? Unreliable sources for data collection, which may result in biased research outcomes. ? Generalization of findings based on few case studies and building cost performances. ? Difficulty of demanding empirical studies (subjective and objective). ? Lack of sophisticated categorization of green building types and reflecting the heterogeneity of green building costs, which may result in finding false correlations between variables.\r\n?

Although some common attributes may apply across different cultures based on evolutionary principles, it is essential to conduct more studies in different parts of the world. In addition, it is also pertinent to fur- ther investigate the interactions of the attributes that evoke fear of crime in urban green spaces. Although it is important to investigate how physical/environmental aspects, such as vegetation character, density, and maintenance, may evoke fear of crime in urban green spaces, it is important to beawarethat these attributesdonot cause fear by themselves. Rather, fear is evoked by a complex interaction of the environment with other attributes (e.g., individual, social). Therefore, amore in-depth understanding of the cumulative effect on fear of crime in urban green spaces should be sought through future research on fear of crime in urban green spaces.\"', NULL, 'No exact search string is provided, a set of keywords are given.', 1, 35),

In particular, we have compared the following studies: a) in the USA, Canada and Sweden that fall under the snowy, fully humid weather, b) in Greece and France in a warm temperate and fully humid weather and c) in Singapore and Brazil in an equatorial climate. From those studies, we have concluded that positive results are comparable between the studies in the same climate classification with minor differences. After further comparing the GDPs of countries compared to the existence of formal policies to promote green roofs, we found that even countries with high GDPs did not consistently adopt policy promoting this technology that has documented benefits and positive results. Based on the findings of the study, there appears to be no consistent relationship between climate or location in which benefits are observed and the existence of policy that promotes the technology to take advantage of those benefits. Many factors exist that influence both the adoption of green innovations and the development of policies to\r\npromote that adoption. This study has provided a first step to explore whether any consistency can be observed across locations with regard to documented benefits of one green innovation (green roofs) and with regard to policies incentivizing the use of that innovation in each climate where benefits were documented. Future research to investigate other socio-economic factors and their direct impact on policy making, with regards to green roofs, may help to better understand what drives the creation of policies to influence the adoption of green innovations, and in turn, the benefits that could derive from broader adoption as a result.\"', NULL, 'Study selection is not systematic, one paper from each country has been hand-picked.', 1, 26),

First, identifying best practices based on expert feedback can lead to mixed and contradictory lists. This is due to the fact that experts usually rely on their own anecdotal experience, which lacks verification and external validity. Second, computer simulations of energy use and carbon emissions have limitations in modeling certain scenarios and practices, especially passive energy conserving strategies. Third, given the complex relationship between people and buildings, it is hard to isolate the impact of a specific design strategy on human performance in a cause- effect relationship. The other limitation of this study that should be noted is that the tools were developed based on opinions, contexts, and climates in the Pacific Northwest, specifically Eugene, OR, and also based on a specific K-12 school typology. We hope to replicate this study in the future in other contexts climate zones, with other school districts and classroom typologies.\r\nIn addition, we intend to develop a series of case studies of school retrofits that demonstrate the application of these guidelines. In terms of achieving our objective of documenting the triple bottom line benefits of these green classroom retrofitting best practices for the planet (CO2 reductions), profit (energy savings), and people (health and performance), the data presented a clear and compelling case that retrofitting existing schools today is extremely cost-effective, and is the right thing to do for the health and learning of our children. It is the goal of this study to reduce the gap in existing knowledge related to the availability of design analyses that target green school retrofits. Most important is the development of the check list as an evidence-based tool readily available for architects, designers, and school principals.

Following a systematic review of the literature 43 studies are identified which measure these effects. Three social influence types are distinguished: interpersonal communication, neighbourhood effect, and social norms. A random-effects meta-analysis with a sample of 21 comparable studies finds that social influence does explain vehicle choices. The overall effect size does not vary significantly between social influence types or between conventionally fuelled or AFV types. Although there is significant heterogeneity between studies, this is explained by differences between countries in terms of their intrinsic cultural receptiveness towards social influence effects. Our findings identify key challenges for vehicle choice research, policy, and modelling analysis, particularly with respect to AFVs.

It directly addresses the issue of improving the behavioural representation of global transport models which largely represent the diffusion of new vehicle technologies through a single representative agent lacking any social context (McCollum et al., 2016). It identifies a spatial element in terms of differences between country cultures in their receptiveness to social influence effects, highlighting the need for adapted planning and policy. It also informs global modelling and analysis with improved behavioural and social realism, with respect to the diffusion of novel technologies such as alternative fuel vehicles.\"', NULL, 'Methodological details are given in an Appendix.\r\n\r\nNo exact search string is given, a set of keywords are given.\r\n\r\nOut of 43 included studies, 2 are grey-literature.', 1, 35),

In particular, this phase highlights a positive trend over recent years. Moreover, the distribution of papers by journal testifies that environmental sustainability regards different research areas (logistics, supply chain management, and transportation; innovation management; information systems; engineering). Concerning the research methodology, the majority of papers are based on surveys, with few papers using models, case studies, and conceptual or mixed approaches.\r\nThe content analysis makes it possible to identify five investigated topic areas: Classification of green initiatives, Green initiatives, and performance, Factors influencing the adoption of green initiatives, the customer perspective in the sustainable supply chain, ICTs supporting green initiatives. The most analysed topic is that of ‘‘factors affecting the adoption of green initiatives”, whereas ‘‘ICTs supporting green initiatives” is a relatively unexplored topic area. The content analysis of these five topic areas has made it possible to identify six main literature gaps. These gaps represent eight possible research questions to be investigated.\r\nStarting from the first topic area (Classification of green initiatives), it emerges the need to analyse and classify the whole set of initiatives affecting a single LSP or multiple supply chain actors to improve their sustainability efforts (first gap). This gap suggests the first research question concerning the identification of an interpretative taxonomy of green initiatives supporting\r\nenvironmental sustainability strategies:\r\nRQ1: How can be identified a comprehensive taxonomy of green initiatives supporting LSPs in the field of environmental sustainability?\r\nThe second topic area (Green initiatives and performance) has shown the need to analyse further the impact of green initiatives on performance, considering the whole set of performance parameters not analysed in the literature (second gap).\r\nThe second research question that arises then is:\r\nRQ2: What is the impact of green initiatives on LSP’s environmental, economic, operational, market and organisational performance?\r\nFurthermore, this second topic area has shown the need for a systemic approach that includes the individual logistics company’s point of view for the assessment of both energy efficiency and the environmental impact of green initiatives on a firm’s performance (third gap). This gap allows the identification the third research question:\r\nRQ3: How can an LSP’s sustainability performance be assessed in terms of both energy efficiency and the environmental impact of green initiatives?\r\nThe third topic area of study (Factors affecting the adoption of green initiatives) has highlighted the necessity for a clear definition of drivers and barriers, the consequent identification of a set of factors that drive or hinder the adoption of green initiatives, contextual classification and a more comprehensive empirical investigation of the logistics service industry (fourth gap). In addition, it seems important to see differences between drivers and barriers affecting long-distance LSP and urban LSP, as this urban focus includes more policy making and regulatory questions relevant for the external impacts.\r\nFrom this gap it is possible to formulate the fourth and fifth research questions:\r\nRQ4: What are the factors influencing the adoption of green initiatives?\r\nRQ5: How do factors influencing the adoption of green initiatives act as drivers and/or barriers?\r\nThe fourth topic area (the customer perspective in the sustainable supply chain) has highlighted that the adoption of collaborative green initiatives based on the dyadic customer-3PL relationship is scarcely analysed (fifth gap). The sixth relevant research question is:\r\nRQ6: How do dyadic customer-3PL relationships support the adoption of collaborative green initiatives?\r\nThe content analysis of the fifth topic area (ICTs supporting green initiatives) shows that the ICTs supporting green initiatives need a more comprehensive analysis in order to study the whole set of tools used by LSPs to improve their environmental behaviour. This issue requires further study regarding the alignment between ICTs used by LSPs and the green initiatives they are meant to support (sixth gap). From this gap the following two research questions may be formulated:\r\nRQ7: How do ICTs support the adoption of green initiatives?\r\nRQ8: What is the degree of alignment between ICTs and the green initiatives they are meant to support?\r\nThese eight research questions identify some possible topic areas in the field of environmental sustainability in the logistics service industry. These areas of investigation need to take into consideration not only the individual LSP, but also the dyadic customer- LSP relationship.', 'None', NULL, 1, 35),

While prin- ciple sets in the first cluster only partially reflect on the systemic perspective of neighborhood development and cover only two of the sustainability criteria, the second cluster set considers the three dimensions to describe system characteristics comprehensively and furthermore contains a paper that refers to all of the examined categories. Analyzing the data set revealed that sustainability criteria correlate with the dimensions of context and structure, and to a lesser extent with the dimension of function. Although papers exist which cover a range of sustainability aspects, no approach complies with all of the generic core criteria aspects posed by Gibson (2006) (see Table 1 and Fig. 3). Yet with regard to existing literature we consider even poorly covered aspects as crucial to foster sustainable development of urban neighborhoods. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurther research is required to improve existing sustainability\r\nprinciples for neighborhoods and investigate additional fields that might be relevant for portraying the sustainability of urban neigh- borhoods comprehensively. The purpose of the integrated principle set for sustainable urban neighborhood development, presented in Fig. 4, is twofold: first, it provides building blocks for practition- ers, guiding urban development toward sustainability and second it serves as a solid starting point for further research.\r\n\r\nBased on the findings we suggest the following road map to achieve a comprehensive and sufficient principle set:\r\n\r\n1. Complement the integrated principle set. Analyzing in detail the different fields of sustainable neighborhood development may reveal aspects that are insufficiently reflected by the integrated principle set presented in this paper. As indicated by the exam- ined criteria “leakage effects” and with regard to the specific setting of urban neighborhoods it appears reasonable that addi- tional principles need to be developed to improve neighborhood sustainability.\r\n\r\n2. Develop a sufficient principle set. Complementing the integrated principle set with additional aspects will generate a vast number of principles, which will be difficult to manage and problematic to apply. With regard to the most relevant sustainability chal- lenges neighborhoods face as well as the potential contributions of a neighborhood to sustainable development, a sufficient set of principles needs to be developed. This step requires a well- considered procedure, integrating knowledge from practitioners and different disciplines to develop a sufficient principle set.\r\n\r\n3. Evaluate the impacts of the sufficient principle set. Past develop- ments of urban neighborhoods to which sustainability principles have been applied should be analyzed in order to learn from existing experience. The evaluation of successful implementa- tions and failures as well as anticipating feasible development paths would provide opportunities to take full advantage of ear- lier investigations and could help develop an adjusted and more robust principle set.\r\n\r\n4. Apply and evaluate the sufficient principle set. The newly devel- oped set needs to be applied and contextualized in different settings in order to be improved and further enhanced. Long- term evaluation of neighborhoods to which the principle set has been applied could suggest further meaningful improvements, especially in the context of sustainable development.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of a comprehensive and sufficient principle set\r\nfor sustainable urban neighborhood development has the potential to provide a compass for practitioners and scientists, bridging the gap between different cultures, disciplines, and between science and society to foster sustainability in and of urban areas. Substantial knowledge, inside as well as outside academia, is available to foster and enhance measures to move toward urban sustainability. There have been numerous ‘real world experiments’ striving for sustain- able neighborhoods that have also provided crucial evidence. An interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach integrating these insights would provide a worthwhile endeavor to empower sci- entists, professionals, and residents in the realm of sustainable development of urban neighborhoods and beyond.\"', NULL, 'This is a qualitative subject selection followed by a quantitative information extraction.', 1, 35),

Only six empirical studies which provide information about this issue were identified in our review. The studies affirm that the progress of the MDG7 is limited at internation- al, national and local level. The studies were highly heteroge- neous in terms of theoretical frameworks, objectives, and methods, including samples and designs. Furthermore, this heterogeneity implies problems in the quality analysis of the studies. The situation of MDG7 must be improved in order to accomplish the objectives (UN, 2009), and new information about the determinants of non-attainment are needed. In our review, we identified socioeconomic inequalities, lack of proper infrastructure and deficient management, lack of political will at the local level, and contamination of the sources assigned to provide water to the population as the main barriers which hinder the progress of MDG7. This information is relevant in terms of political action, especially at the local and national level, and helps to build new policies to avoid obstacles of its achievement. Weonly found one review regardingMDGprogress (Palma-\r\nSolis et al., 2009a,b) in which political and economic factors were identified as barriers. These barriers were also identified in our research. We know that an increasing amount of knowledge exists around other MDG. For instance, Fotso et al. (2007) analysehowurban growth, access to drinking waterand vaccination coverage affect progress towards MDG 4 in Sub- Saharan Africa. Palma-Solis et al. (2009a,b) analysed policy determinants of the MDG1 (hunger and poverty), identifying government consumption as a barrier to achieve MDG1. Furthermore, Houweling et al. (2007) propose research to demonstrate how socioeconomic inequalities in maternity care affect Goal 5 (reduction in maternal mortality). We identified less information for MDG7 than for the other MDGs. However, scientific knowledge is fundamental for the design of further interventions to achieve the Millennium Develop- ment Goals (Tugwell et al., 2006) and could identify structural or social problems that prevent the achievement of this macro agreement and future agreements. \r\n\r\nA large scale international agreement on the environment\r\nsuch as the Rio de Janeiro (UN, 1992) declaration on environment and development, which laid the foundations for action against what was then an emerging problem, and the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCC, 1997) for the reduction of contaminating gases, failed to achieve the targets set out. It would seem that MDG7 will go the same way. Despite the importance of ensuring environmental sustainability of population health and welfare (McMichael et al., 2008), the environmental issue do not seem to be a priority in research and political agendas, while the international organisations continue to insist that the objective is extremely important (Sachs and McArthur, 2005; Jolly, 2004) and urge countries to persevere. Adiscipline like political epidemiology could play a key role in the identification of political determinants which affect social factors and progress of MDGs, and in the proposal of future public policies to improve the achievement of targets. With MDGs, the UN applies a model comprised of wishful thinking, opinion, and good intentions that is limited by the lack of a solid scientific base, given the dearth of scientific information concerning the health implications of political initiatives (Gil-Gonza\r\n´lez et al., 2009). We encountered limitations when carrying out this\r\nsystematic review. The first of these was the small sample of studies, their heterogenic characteristics, and the fact that they are studies which came from different disciplines like urbanism, environment, health, and development. In addi- tion, all of the studies expressed their results in a particular form.We also had difficulties extracting data and comparing results between papers with different designs, which in most cases only permitted a descriptive analysis of their results. Finally, knowledge relevant for the MDGs may be generated in many contexts; e.g., by scientists unaware of MDGs or by institutions with no interest in MDGs, but we limited our research to knowledge generated around MDG7 through empirical studies published in scientific journals and grey literature from different organizations. In the current framework of climate change, it is essential to implement policies for sustainable development and preservation of natural resources, the use of renewable, clean energy (Haines et al., 2007), and sustainable urban develop- ment. These may provide the definitive push towards the environmental goal, and could enhance the situation of the health and education targets (McMichael et al., 2008; Bartram et al., 2005). Furthermore, it is important to create a space for reflection (James, 2006; Anand, 2007; Bass et al., 2006) which would enable a detailed review of the weak points (Murray, 2007) of the indicators for measuring progress, in order to adapt them to the new challenges of the environment.\"', NULL, NULL, 1, 35);

This present analysis was guided by a specific question: What is the state of study on regulations and policies for distributed generation? Systematic reviews are not “infallible ap- proach[es] to discerning broad findings from a body of scientific work” [60], as there are instances for error due to interpretation inconsis- tencies. \r\n\r\nWith regards to improving the meta-analysis, a possible solution is\r\nto include “grey literature” into the review. This would allow for a comparison between data extracted from peer-reviewed documents and other sources. In this case, certain precautions would need to be taken. This study was limited to peer-reviewed literature because it is considered to be “a widely accepted and scientifically rigorous source” [61]. Reports prepared by international organizations such as the International Energy Agency, IEA of the OECD, the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA of the United Nations, and other renewable energy organizations or research institutions would certainly enrich the analysis. However, caution would be warranted since they are not scrutinized through the peer-review process and may present preferences associated with the institution [62]. DG is a relatively new policy, especially in the case of some jurisdictions in the Americas. Peer-reviewed studies, being subject to rigorous review can also involve lag-times up to 2 years, for this reason grey-literature could, therefore enhance the present analysis. \r\n\r\nThe results of this paper will be useful as a springboard for future\r\nstudy. The larger research plan with a comparison of Canada and Brazil as objects of study will benefit from the characteristics identified, such as a large discrepancy in motivating factors in the two cases for DG. \r\n\r\nOverall, the findings of the systematic review show that there is\r\nlittle emphasis given in previously published works to understand social impacts and benefits of distributed technologies, an issue that policy makers will have to address if policy interventions to mitigate climate change can be fully realized. Additionally, specific urban challenges and governance at the local scale for distributed generation is not widely investigated, pointing to a need for future study that considers such institutional considerations. \r\n\r\nThe systematic review is a promising technique for conducting a\r\nliterature review, one that avoids bias in data collection and analysis but also lends itself to comparison. The methodology could be easily applied to another geographical region, such as Africa, Asia or Europe allowing for comparison and therefore, global insights into the proble- matic of policies and regulations for distributed, small-scale electricity generation.\"', NULL, 'Articles written in Portuguese, Spanish and French were considered in this review in addition to English articles.', 3, 35),

The English language literature is geographically and culturally uneven with few papers from Africa and South America and with most from the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The majority of studies used surveys or questionnaires as their main form of data collection, and the most common sampling method used was convenience sampling. There is relatively little duplication in the survey questions used in different studies which makes accurate comparisons between the results of papers difficult. Even more concerning, only one longitudinal study had been conducted which raises a number of issues regarding the tracking of consumer and lodging provider behaviour change. There is clearly substantial need for monitoring material flows over time while simultaneously tracking the attitudes of managers, staff and customers as well as the impacts of new technologies and interventions so as to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the various activities that can lead to positive change. Similarly, there are few studies that clearly indicate the results of any intervention into influencing consumptive behaviour and none of these are tracked over time—the assumption clearly being made that changes in messaging, for example, will be maintained as the resultant behaviours have become new norms, even if those messages may then be removed from hotel rooms. Such long-term tracking is essential, for example, to compare the value of norm and non-norm approaches to encouraging customer behaviours [42,70], while the potential value of norm-based approaches for staff and managers is also a potentially significant area of study [82]. However, it must be emphasised that norm-based approaches, while having significant potential, also need to be examined in a far wider cultural context than what has so far been the case. In addition, there is insufficient reporting of the actual changes to quantities of energy, food and water consumed, or the production of waste which any intervention has influenced. We do not know, for example, whether any rebound effects have occurred so that reductions in consumption and/or waste in one area of an organisation have been accompanied by increases elsewhere [131].\r\n\r\n\r\nA clear outcome of the study therefore is that there is a greater need for integrated long-term\r\nstudies of accommodation and lodging firms and their consumers. Although environmental management systems approaches [7], for example, highlight the need for inclusion of all stakeholders in improving system sustainability, this is not reflected in the literature. Only five studies included lower level employees in assessments of sustainable behaviour and practices [80–84], even though they are the staff who actually implement any intervention. There is therefore a clear need for studies that seek to compare not only the attitude and behaviour gaps within stakeholder groups, such as consumers and managers, but also between such groups, and then seek to chart how practices change and are maintained over time in light of any differences in physical infrastructure and/or behavioural interventions.\"', NULL, '\"Author Contributions: Colin Michael Hall and Leroy Paul-Andrews conceived and designed the systematic analysis; Colin Michael Hall, Natasha Dayal, Dea Majstorovi´\r\nc, Hamish Mills, Leroy Paul-Andrews and\r\nChloe Wallace performed the systematic analysis; Colin Michael Hall, Natasha Dayal, Dea Majstorovi´\r\nc,\r\nHamish Mills, Leroy Paul-Andrews and ChloeWallace analyzed the data; Colin Michael Hall, Natasha Dayal, Dea Majstorovi´\r\nc, Hamish Mills, Leroy Paul-Andrews, ChloeWallace and Van Dao Truong wrote the paper\"', 3, 35),

Some empirical studies in the literature reported that an unpriced green- house gas emissions lead to a negative externality and a carbon price shifts these burden from society to those who trade in carbon-intensive goods [65,66,96,97]. Our results confirm that carbon price vis-a-vis carbon tax and carbon emissions trading is the central research theme in climate change mitigation policies and also affirms the fact that emission reduction target remains a top priority of the national climate change stakeholders. A considerable amount of literature has been published on renewable energy and energy efficiency and identified the two as the main drivers of low-carbon economic transition. Other themes such as carbon capture and storage, carbon linkages, and co- benefit of mitigation measures are shown to be key mitigating options.\r\n\r\nStudies of CGE and its application on climate mitigation policy are predominantly restricted to East Asia & Pacific, Europe and North America, with the United States, China, Japan, and Germany leading the CGE research destinations while CGE applications in other countries or regions have received little to no attention to date. However, these four countries are major emitters of CO2 emissions; accounting for 28%, 16%, 4% and 2% of gross emissions respectively across the world [98] and research into these countries can provide a useful roadmap for global emission reduction. However, other regions constitute almost half of the global carbon emissions, hence, attention in these areas is urgently needed. In all, USA remained the largest source of CGE application in climate change mitigation research, as does China as the leading research recipient.\r\n\r\nMany studies focus on sectoral analyses in the key emitting sectors\r\nsuch as energy [99], agriculture [100], forestry/forest [101], and transport sector [102], with the aim of offering purposive insight into the specific sectoral mitigation policy measures. Energy production and use are undoubtedly the largest sources of greenhouse gas emission and many studies have tried to simulate its roadmap to a low carbon sector [103–110]. However, research on another sector such as; agriculture, industry, forestry/forest, transport, buildings, and waste has been under-represented, given their high economic mitigation potentials as reported by International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014 [111]. More CGE applications are needed in other key emitting sectors towards providing right inputs into the national and global policy formation process towards agreeable global green- house gas emission reduction.\r\n\r\nStatic CGE model has dominated the literature since the 1990s,\r\nwith recursive-dynamic gaining momentum and full dynamic model barely applied to climate mitigation. Therefore, its applications are very diverse and pay more attention to national issues and sizable modelling efforts are devoted to regional and global mitigation scenarios. However, the standard static CGE models do not carve in time and expect that adjustment occurs spontaneously. Hence, the static model has been described as analytically inconsistent [112] and recursive dynamic model termed myopic by Manne [113]. Since the problem of climate change is for an extended period [114], further research is required to employ other macroeconomic models so as to explicitly simulate each variable through time, which is considered more realistic. CGE models, although used in the dynamic macroeconomic analysis, lack necessary toolkit to fit in with the contemporary macroeconomics that rather concentrates on Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models [24]. The CGE and DSGE as neoclassical models rely heavily on logically inconsistent assumptions [115–117], hence, more research is needed to explore other models such as Agent-Based Model (ABM) technique. ABM is ideally suited to such a task by providing more realistic representations, a dynamic and spatial environment in which a large number of heterogeneous and complex agents can interact and evolve [118–121].\"\r\n', NULL, NULL, 1, 35),

Future researchers should conduct in depth qualitative analyses to quantify the factors that could possibly affect household energy consumption and could affect energy efficiency.

Leadership is needed by organizations like American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy to help reduce household energy consumption and to optimize energy efficiency by assisting in the development of best practices and policies.

After filtering, 36 articles were found to be relevant and considered valid for further analysis. It is important to note that this study is solely focused on reviewing and drawing conclusions from the relevant articles that were obtained through the specific literature search approach adopted, but not on a review of the complete population of articles on the topic.', 36, 1, 0, '\"This paper has conducted a systematic review of literature on barriers to GB adoption. The Scopus search engine was used to collect relevant academic (peer-reviewed) journal articles reviewed in this study. \r\n\r\nFrom the first objective of reviewing literature on GB barriers, it was found that there are many barriers affecting GB adoption, but the most reported barriers in the literature are lack of information, cost, lack of incentives/support, lack of interest and demand, and lack of GB codes and regulations, implying that these are the major barriers hin- dering the adoption of GB in the global construction community. \r\n\r\nThe second objective was to recommend measures to overcome the barriers to GB adoption. Therefore, in this section, possible measures elicited from the literature are proposed to overcome each of the five major barriers iden- tified above. First of all, it is recommended that, to overcome the barriers, a strong collaborative system between gov- ernment (policy maker), industry associations and companies that are developing GBs (involving contractors and developers) is needed. It has been suggested that government involvement is one of the most important and effec- tive ways to promote GB adoption (Chen, 2007; Zhang and Wang, 2013). The government is responsible for the for- mulation of effective evaluation mechanisms and preferential GB policy frameworks and for administration of effective GB incentives, while industry associations provide useful guidance and encouragement to contractors and developers to pursue GB. Industry associations also facilitate the sharing of useful GB information between contractor and developer firms (Shi et al., 2013). Hence, a strong collaboration among this group of stakeholders would be valuable for promoting GB development.\r\n\r\nThis review showed that lack of information (as a result of insufficient GB research and education), which causes lack of knowledge and public awareness on GB, is the most reported barrier to GB adoption in the literature, confirming the usefulness of information in GB implementation. The implication of this finding is that better in- formation on GB cost and benefits, green suppliers and technologies should be made available by government. Potbhare et al. (2009) established that the availability of better information is the most essential incentive to simu- late GB adoption in society. Hence, in order to ensure the successful and widespread acceptance of GB in the mar- ket, the ‘information barrier’ needs to be resolved in advance. One suggestion is that government should further investigate the GB concept and how GB investments contribute to a vibrant local economy (e.g. contributions of GB to job creation), and organize some transparent and up-to-date reports, statements and messages supporting the social, economic and environmental benefits of GBs (Li et al., 2014). This information can be distributed to so- ciety through, for example, print media, radio programs and television shows; a dedicated website to serve as a da- tabase for reputable, current, and standardized GB data may also be useful. These information dissemination efforts can help to enhance stakeholders’ knowledge and awareness of GB. In addition, in partnership with industry asso- ciations, government can lunch communication campaigns and organize builder workshops to inform contractors and developers about the competitive advantage and market benefits that GB adoption can offer them. As contrac- tors and developers become aware of the market edge and green brand reputation from adopting GB, their enthu- siasm will naturally be raised (Tan et al., 2011). Also, government should make GB research and education a priority and intensify GB education programs in academic institutions, with maximum support for reliable GB research. When this is done, researchers should share information such as information on innovative technologies, informa- tion on durability of green materials and summaries of GB research findings (Rodriguez-Nikl et al., 2015) with in- dustry practitioners. GB education programs can also be set up for contractors and developers to expand their GB knowledge and thus encourage them to increasingly adopt GB.\r\n\r\nThe findings show that cost is the second most reported barrier in the literature that deters market stakeholders from GB adoption. The major recommendation is that to overcome this barrier the perception that the extra cost of GB affects the competitive advantage of the stakeholder must be changed. Most people hold this perception because they are unaware of how to improve their market competitiveness and financial advantages in the face of the incre- mental cost from adopting GB projects. Therefore, research works on (1) the lifecycle approach for assessing the cost and impact of GBs (Shi et al., 2012), (2) how to increase the market competitiveness and financial advantages of stakeholders (Lam et al., 2009), especially developers who peruse GB, and (3) analysis of the lifecycle performance and benefits of GBs so that shareholders can understand that GBs perform better than conventional buildings and offer several social, economic and environmental benefits (such as reduced operation and maintenance costs, and better indoor environment) are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe results indicate that a lack of incentives/support is affecting the widespread adoption of GB. This finding hasa number of implications for both government and other stakeholders. To overcome this barrier, two main types of incentive (i.e. external and internal incentives) are required (see Olubunmi et al., 2016). The government is mainly responsible for administering external incentives (which include financial and non-financial incentives), whereas in- ternal incentives require stakeholders to incentivize themselves to adopt GB due to the potential benefits to be reaped (Choi, 2009; Olubunmi et al., 2016). The suggestion is that, to drive and motivate stakeholders to adopt GB, government should provide sound, effective and encouraging financial and non-financial incentive policies. Government can consider granting financial incentives (such as tax incentives, direct grants and rebates), which are monetary in nature, to developers and owners who meet some green requirements or if their buildings turn out to be green (by receiving a GB certification system’s recognition). This will help to partially pay or compensate companies and owners for the additional costs and efforts involved in developing GBs, thereby reducing the effects of the ‘high cost barrier’ as well (Geng et al., 2012; Hwang and Tan, 2012). Non-financial incentives such as floor area incentives (i.e. granting of additional floor area) and provision of technical assistance to stakeholders who fulfil specific green requirements can also be adopted by government to encourage GB adoption. Moreover, when admin- istering GB incentives, government should consider widening the scope to cover not only the owners, contractors and developers but also individuals or tenants who pursue GB by using green products or purchasing GBs so that demand can be high. Interested readers are referred to the work of Qian and Chan (2008, 2010) and Qian (2010) for lists of more examples of GB incentives. In the GB incentive context, aside from the role of government, as men- tioned earlier, owners, customers and developers should also play their part by adopting GB out of personal volition or conviction considering the benefits of GB. The adoption of GB is more likely to increase along with the provision of encouraging incentives.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results show that lack of interest and demand is also a major barrier discouraging stakeholders, especially developers, from taking up GB projects. The implication is that there is a need for government agencies to urgently explore ways to simulate demand from stakeholders. One recommendation is that green construction tours and workshops, in addition to credible GB research, should be organized to educate the public and clients on the importance of GB so as to develop their awareness and consequently interest, and create high market demand for GBs. It is believed that clients’ education on the benefits of GB would help to address the ‘high cost barrier’ as well (Geng et al., 2012; Hwang and Tan, 2012). Evidence points to a lack of public interest in and demand for GBs; therefore, these efforts to heighten the interest of stakeholders to drive demand are significant for GB promotion. \r\n\r\nThis review indicates that lack of GB codes and regulations is a major barrier hindering GB adoption. This means that government should create clear national public policy packages, aimed at catalyzing the adoption of GB among stakeholders – and make these policies mandatory. Mandatory GB policies are very important for driving GB adop- tion, as stakeholders usually adopt GB principles just to satisfy mandatory requirements (Lam et al., 2009). For this reason, government should consider imposing mandatory regulations such as (1) the attainment of certain levels of GB certification (e.g. receiving at least one-star certification) before releasing construction permission, (2) financial penalties for disobeying mandatory standards and (3) mandatory minimum building energy-efficiency standards on market stakeholders in order to encourage investments in GB. As one of the most cost-effective ways in promoting GB adoption (Varone and Aebischer, 2001; LeVan and Atsusaka, 2003), it is essential to utilize mandatory laws to guide GB implementation. \r\n\r\nThis study has contributed to the knowledge of barriers affecting GB adoption by identifying the most reported barriers in the literature. The findings are important because they provide information on major barriers in GB im- plementation, leading to a better understanding of what is stopping the rapid adoption of GBs from a global perspec- tive. Industry practitioners and policy makers would be able to identify gaps in GB implementation and thus discover key areas where policy or strategy initiatives can help accelerate GB adoption. The contribution to the global construction community is that a list of recommendations is provided to overcome the barriers to GB adoption for SD. It is expected that, when the barriers are overcome, stakeholders would be more keen to increase the adoption of green instead of conventional features in future construction projects. Additionally, the checklist of GB barriers and references provided in this paper may be relevant to scholars for further empirical studies on GB barriers in different locations.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n', NULL, 'Conference papers have been excluded without further evaluation of quality.', 1, 35),

Hence, policy pointers for which drivers to target can be derived. \r\n\r\nThe most important message from the driver analysis is to think in terms of policy mixes, rather than focusing on single instruments. While some driver interrelations seem to underlie unsustainable use of different resource types, others are affected by more case specific constellations of drivers. Given such complex network of drivers, clear-cut disentanglement of causation may only be achievable for very specific contexts. Nonetheless, on a more general level, we need to acknowledge the role that behaviour plays as a driver for unsustainable resource use e not just in relation to consumer behaviour (e.g. explaining rebound effects from efficiency gains), but also in regard to how industrial and political actors make decisions in production processes and policy processes. Changing those behavioural, institutional and organisational structures that lock-in unsustainable resource use is a formidable challenge. Analysing the network of drivers mayexplain why: existing world views, social practices, infrastructures and also power structures make initiating change difficult. Hence, policy mixes are needed that will target different drivers in a systematic way.\r\n\r\nHere, we recommend that policy makers (1) scrutinise the\r\nspecific driver network of their subject matter, (2) identify direct and indirect key drivers, (3) select and combine relevant policy objectives and policy instruments that target the key direct and indirect drivers (4) and implement them in a time-dynamic sequence. \r\n\r\nAs limitations to our analysis may arise from incomplete knowledge of literature providing relevant data and from incorrectly relating the drivers to unsustainable resource use, more research is needed to disentangle the complex network of drivers and to better understand the cumulative effect of interrelations between drivers and resource use. Here, our analysis may inform future use of econometric analysis for resource policy and may direct researchers to relevant driver-related research questions. In addition, the issue of policy mixes is a rather novel concept for resource policy (Bleischwitz, 2012) and should receive further attention by scientists.', NULL, 'Claims to be a \'qualitative meta-analysis\'.', 1, 35),

We reviewed studies that have investigated the effects of green space on temperatures and these studies present evidence that urban greening, such as parks and trees may act to cool the environ- ment, at least at a local scale. Meta-analysis of data from different studies suggested that, on average, an urban park would be around 1C cooler than a non-green site. However, this evidence is mostly basedonobservational data of existing green spaces. Therefore, this hypothesis should continue to be tested through the appropriate monitoring of any urban greening programmes. Monitoring should include collection of temperature data before and after implemen- tation along with comparable ‘control’ non-green sites. \r\n\r\nStudies that measured temperature from multiple parks in the\r\nsame urban area presented data showing that larger parks were cooler. Local climatemayalso affect the temperature of green space but most studies only collected data from 1 urban area. The studies also show the effects of different types of vegetation, particularly the difference between short vegetation, such as grass, and tree canopy cover. Shade from trees has been shown to be important for lowering temperatures; however, temperatures have also been shown to be lower in unshaded green sites or above short vege- tation, which suggests evaporative cooling may also play a role. Further research is needed on how the benefits of green space change with the particular context, such as local urban environ- ment, climate and type of greening. \r\n\r\nThe extension of the cooling effect of a green area beyond its\r\nboundary is supported by data from a few studies. The scale of any cooling effect beyond the boundary of the green area is particularly important for the likely public health consequences of greening, as green space may not be directly accessible to all who might ben- efit during very high temperatures. We would therefore suggest that a key line of future research is to explicitly investigate the dis- tance and size-dependence of the effects of green areas, allowing explicit bottom-up predictions of the effect of particular amounts and spatial arrangements of greening. \r\n\r\nGiven the difficulties in conducting well-replicated and exper-\r\nimental research on these topics, drawing results across different studies becomes even more important to enable more general con- clusions to be drawn, rather than relying on simple case studies of individual green areas. Improvements in reporting temperature data and information on the type of greening and urban site under study would allow more powerful meta-analyses.

Our results confirm that the variability of social and ecological qualities ofUGSlackswidespread recognition in research fields, given 72% of studies used five or fewer qualities to define greenspace, and ‘physical’ and ‘descriptive’ qualities were themost commonly used.We anticipate our typology can help academics, policy and decision makers and various stakeholders to acknowledge the range of qualities that collectively determine how heterogeneous UGS is, and can help to clarify howdifferent types ofUGS can be defined and conceptualised.Given the goal ofmuch research into greenspace is to ascertain the values that these spaces contribute to urban society, it’s important to understand the social and ecological qualities that provide conditions for these values to be generated. This will involve controlling for confounding variables (either in the experimental design or statistically), which may be missed when certain qualities of UGS are not acknowledged. \r\n\r\nWe hope that by future studies adopting, adapting, contributing to, and thereby improving our typology, we can increase transparency and advance our understanding of this multidis- ciplinary research area. With the ultimate goal to understand what types of UGS confer the greatest benefits to society, this is the first typology we know of that is compiled based on the qualities of greenspaces as opposed to the types of greenspaces (see Swanwick 2009). We believe this typology can provide a platform for future research, and a framework for researchers, local governments and stakeholders to understand, plan and manage the complex nature of UGS more effectively.\"', NULL, 'Claims to be a \"semi-systematic\" review.

Furthermore, studies focusing only on occupational and/or household PA as dependent variable were excluded, since these behaviors are bounded to very specific contexts (i.e., the workplace and home residence) and, consequently, are less susceptible to changes in physical environmental attributes of the residential neighborhood. Concerning the independent variable, studies that only focused on the socio-cultural, economic or policy environment were excluded.

Transportation PA, rather than PA with a recre- ational purpose, appears to be more consistently related to the physical environment. First, convincing evidence on positive relationships between particular domains of PA emerged for the environmental attributes walkability, access to shops/services/work and environmental qual- ity, and this evidence contributed to a more complete view on the existing evidence worldwide. However, causal relationships could not be revealed yet, because longitudinal studies were absent. Next, there was pos- sible evidence on a positive relationship for transporta- tion PA and walking/cycling facilities, and on a negative relationship of transportation cycling with hilliness. Al- though these findings seem promising in completing existing knowledge, this possible evidence is less strong than the convincing results we found for other environ- mental factors, such as walkability, and needs more rigorous investigation before generalizations can be made. The lack of associations between domain-specific PA and access to recreation facilities, aesthetics, crime- and traffic-related safety was contrasting with earlier, non-Europe-specific reviews. This suggests that these factors might play a less important role from a European PA perspective. At last, the relationship between a con- siderable amount of environmental attributes and\r\nparticular particular PA domains is still understudied in European research. Therefore, increasing research on relationships between PA and the three walkability components (i.e., residential density, land use mix diversity and street con- nectivity), access to public transportation, quality and presence of walking and cycling facilities, hilliness and general measures of the environmental quality is highly encouraged.\"', NULL, 'Includes a detailed presentations of statistical distribution of the selected studies.', 3, 35),

Further, hospital architecture and engineering had been reviewed previously,11 as has LCA in medicine,22 thus we did not include all of the associated references contained within these works. \r\n\r\nWe found many relevant research findings from a var- iety of academic disciplines, yet there remain substan- tial knowledge gaps. Engineering and architectural research concerning hospital buildings and the technol- ogies used within them is at a relatively mature stage, but less is known about the clinical, psychological and social factors which influence how healthcare profes- sionals use these buildings and technologies. Further research is also needed to understand how the environ- mental effects of procured goods can be reduced, and how potential trade-offs between sustainability and ser- vice quality/cost can be minimized.\r\n\r\nThe need for research extends well beyond hospital settings to include public health research aiming to understand how best to reduce demand for hospital care and its associated environmental effects. Further research is needed in the following areas:\r\n. Measurement of the ‘footprints’ of hospitals- buildings, energy and water, transport and the life cycles of procured items and processes/patient care.\r\n. Innovations (technological, clinical, organizational, etc.) that will improve the sustainability of healthcare.\r\n. Social and psychological research to understand the behaviours, attitudes and cultures that will be needed within hospitals and our wider society to improve sustainability.\r\n. Policy research to clarify how the overall design of health systems influences the uptake of sustainable behaviours and innovations.\r\n. Assessing the anticipated effects of environmental and climate change on health and hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impetus to conduct research across these areas will come both from ‘push’ factors such as compliance with environmental legislation, and ‘pull’ factors centred on the potential patient benefits of sustainable healthcare. The UK’s 2008 Climate Change Act man- dates the entire UK to reduce CO2 emissions by 34% by 2020, and by 80% by 2050. Even in countries with- out similarly ambitious policies, other legislative requirements may provide further impetus for research. \r\n\r\nMost research on hospital sustainability (e.g. architecture) has been performed by specialists in isolation, with minimal clinician participation. Due to the broad nature of hospital sustainability, collaboration will be needed to improve research outcomes. This collabor- ation includes: clinicians, engineers, architects, chemists/pharmacists, life cycle assessors and social sci- entists. Joint work between different specialties is now occurring, e.g. LCAs of medical devices. Collaboration between engineers and clinicians to achieve energy and water efficiencies while also improving or at least not adversely affecting patient outcomes would be valuable. Clarifying barriers to change, particularly behavioural, will be the domain of social scientists working with clinicians. A significant barrier to research is the diffi- culty building collaborative funding arrangements. \r\n\r\nThe global nature of the ‘sustainability challenge’indicates that collaboration will also be needed across national frontiers, with international bodies such as the World Health Organisation and health and environ- mental NGOs playing an important coordinating role. Developing the evidence to support a sustainable approach to healthcare represents a challenge to the international health research community, but one that it cannot afford to ignore.\"', NULL, NULL, 1, 35),

In order to know if the targets are on their right trajectory paths, we need to know how willing households are in shifting to RES use, which is typically gauged by theirWTP. This paper provides a meta-analysis on the willingness-to-pay for the use of renewable energy source. We find that urban residents and North American households to have higher WTP, while Asian households have lower WTP. This is perhaps due to differences in terms of knowledge, information, awareness, and exposure to RES use.We also find what seemed to be genuine underlying empirical effects that more and more households are increasingly willing to pay for RES use. The type of RES however do not seem to be important in determining WTP, nor do the temporal mode of\r\npayment. Households might be demonstrating certain degrees of flexibility with regards to the types of RES and whether they pay for it monthly or annually.

The analysis has identified key characteris- tics that determine peoples\' WTP for green electricity, at least for developed countries, since regional coverage in developing countries is low. Further, althoughwe used samplingweights,we cannot guaran- tee that our results are not driven by WTP elicited by few studies (e.g. Borchers et al., 2007), or driven by WTP elicited in few countries (especially US and Italy).\r\n\r\nIn general, people are willing to pay for green electricity. People in\r\nFinland and the US express the largest WTPs per household and per month, while people in Chile, Italy and Germany have the highest WTP per kilowatt-hour. Countries with high electricity consumption per capita but lowenergy prices, such as the US and Finland, naturally state a higher WTP per household, but a low WTP per kilowatt-hour. However, WTP per kilowatt-hour is seldom reported in the literature. This could be because study participants may have a better overview of their monthly electricity expenditures than of the electricity price per kilowatt-hour. Nevertheless, politicians lean onWTP values provided by researches\r\nso it is important to communicate WTP influencing factors, and to expressWTP values in feasible units, e.g. aWTP per kilowatt-hour if pol- iticians need advice choosing an optimal tax on electricity. That iswhy we recommend researches either to directly use the unit kilowatt- hour instated preferenceWTP questionsor to convert values per house- holdpermonthbyusing informationabouthousehold-size andelectric- ity consumption. Turning to the quantitative results of this article, our meta-\r\nregression shows that, in contrast to other renewable energy sources, a higher share of hydropower in a country\'s electricity generation re- duces WTP for renewable energy. One possible explanation might be that hydropower consumes more land and has amore significant envi- ronmental impact than other types of renewables. Furthermore, people who are informed on the type of power plant to be substituted by re- newables, tend to exhibit a higherWTP. This gives evidence that accep- tance of renewable energies strongly depends on informing people about concrete plans, alternatives and status quo.\r\n\r\nSignificance of the dummy variables, describing the explanatory\r\nvariables of study\'s WTP estimation, suggests that controlling for knowledge about renewables, household characteristics, income and education significantly influencesWTP estimates. Ignoring these attri- butes in future WTP estimations might result in biassed coefficients. Our analysis gives evidence that significance of other explanatory variables is caused by characteristics which are related to a specific study site; that is, theymight result in another effect direction, such as regional effects, which are not caused by the region itself, but its characteristics. Similar, studies state inconclusive WTP values for an increase in\r\nbiomass. It seems that the acceptance of this renewable energy facility depends on characteristics which are not covered by our meta- regression, such as land use change. For this reason, our value transfer for an increase in biomass fails.Nevertheless,when restricting the sam- ple to the otherWTP values,we are able to predict theWTP per house- hold permonth with amedian percentage error of 21% and a MAPE of 36%. These values are comparable to the transfer errors reported in other value transfer exercises (but not related to renewable energy; e.g. Brouwer, 2000). Further, the median absolute error of the value transfer is very small (about 1.75 US$ per household per month).

(47, 'Age and environmental sustainability: a meta-analysis', 2013, 5, 'Age vs environmental attitudes', 0, 0, 1970, 2010, NULL, 'Manual search is followed by manual examination of individual article to evaluate the relevance.', 68, 4, 1, '\"This quantitative review summarized data from the last four decades of psychological research on environmental sustainability and clarified relationships of environmental sustainability variables with age. Overall, most environmental sustainability variables displayed no or negligible relationships with age. From an organizational perspective, negligible age effects indicate a positive finding. For the most part, groups of individuals of different ages are unlikely to have different environmental attitudes (concern, values, commitment, as well as attitudes toward environmental behaviors), motives, or intentions, or to display different levels of pro-environmental behaviors. In terms of most environmental variables, this suggests that deficiencies and strengths are similar for older and younger individuals. For pro-environmental behaviors, the finding of mostly negligible age relationships echoes the recent meta-analytic findings for age-work performance relationships. Ng and Feldman (2008) reported that ten dimensions of job performance (core task performance, creativity, performance in training programs, organizational citizenship behaviors, safety performance, general counterproductive work behaviors, workplace aggression, on-the-job substance use, tardiness, and absenteeism) showed negligible to small correlations with age. However, for four environmental variables, relationships with age were positive, more sizable (0.17-0.22), and generalizable. Older individuals were found to be more motivated by social norms. As we hypothesized, this may be because older individuals tend to be more agreeable (Roberts et al., 2006) and more concerned with protecting their emotional comfort by maintaining harmony in their social groups (Carstensen et al., 1999). Turning to pro-environmental behaviors, studies conducted since 1995 indicated that older individuals also conserved more and harmed the environment less. This may be because older individuals tend to be more conscientious (Roberts et al., 2006) and because they value frugality (Smola and Sutton, 2002). That is, these were the behavioral facets where conscientiousness and traditional work values might make a difference (avoiding harm to the environment and conserving resources). As organizations seek to become more environmentally responsible, they can likely rely on their older workers to lead the way in avoiding waste, recycling materials, and preventing harm to the environment. Finally, older individuals also appeared to engage more frequently with nature.\r\n\r\nFor our findings on conserving behaviors, the year of data collection moderated the relationship with age. Before 1995, age was not meaningfully related to conserving behaviors (measured predominantly as recycling). For studies conducted in 1995 or later, however, the relationship was consistently positive. This may be due to a generational effect. In most of the industrialized world, throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, public encouragement for pro-environmental behavior was common due to the burgeoning environmental movement as well as rising energy costs, especially for behaviors relating to the three R’s (reducing, reusing, recycling), all of which are conserving behaviors. During this period, people of many age groups were likely to engage in such behaviors due to ubiquitous encouragement, thus reducing the range in this variable and leading to a negligible age effect. The 1980s and early 1990s, however, were “decades of consumption” in the industrialized world and were politically more conservative in many countries (particularly North America, the UK, and other European countries such as Germany and France). As a result, during that time, pro-environmental messages were less common in the media and in schools[2]. By the mid-1990s, the youngest people sampled were likely to have been less exposed to environmental messages and thus less likely to have developed the same conserving habits as older generations. In addition, this period coincided with times of greater political security and economic wealth, which could have further de-emphasized the necessity to conserve among young people who had never encountered hardship comparable to that experience by the two post-world war generations. Lower incidences of conserving behaviors among younger individuals in those later samples may be the reason for a reversal of the age-conserving effect and a positive relationship after 1995. This change in relationship illustrates how generational effects can influence the observed age-differences across samples. Societal changes over time appear to have resulted in very different patterns of conserving behavior across samples. Though a similar cohort effect was not present in our other analyses, future research on age-differences in environmental behaviors should carefully consider how observed effects might be moderated by this kind of societal evolution. Future studies may benefit from employing longitudinal or cohort-sequential designs to systematically investigate the influence of aging and generational effects on the relationship between age and environmental variables. From an organizational point-of-view, the present results are encouraging, at least\r\ngiven the current demographic realities of aging workforces in the industrialized world. Contrary to some stereotypes, in the most crucial domains of environmental sustainability (conserving and avoiding harm), it is not the older generation of workers that will need coaching. In fact, younger employees may benefit from modeling behaviors of older employees in this regard. On the other hand, both generations of employees are likely to benefit from training and organizational support when it comes to making responsible product choices, undertaking environmental sustainability initiatives, and exerting sustainability-related influence on others. An interesting observation from our investigation of age-differences in\r\nenvironmental sustainability is the similarity of environmental commitment and concern for younger and older individuals versus meaningful differences in actual avoiding harm and conservation behaviors. Environmental commitment and concern appear to translate into these specific pro-environmental behaviors for older but not younger individuals. Future research may wish to examine the situational constraints and psychological barriers that hamper younger workers in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to removing barriers, all employees, but especially younger workers in\r\nrelatively low-level positions, should be actively encouraged to prevent environmental harmby explicitly rewarding positive behaviors and discouraging negative ones. This study’s findings on environmental motives suggest that compared to older individuals, younger individuals will be less receptive to interventions that appeal to social norms. Thus, interventions will likely need to be individually focused on rewards and commendation, rather than established organizational rules and norms. This is yet another domain in which older employees may be of value. Organizations would be well-advised to incorporate criteria of environmental responsibility into their performance management process, both in a formalized (e.g. performance appraisal) and informal manner (e.g. mentoring). Although most of the effects reported in this meta-analysis were negligible or small,\r\nwe would like to stress that many of these effects, even those of small magnitude, may be interesting and important to applied psychologists. In the field of work psychology, small effects can have substantial consequences in organizations when cumulated across individuals and occasions. For example, in a computer simulation of multi-level\r\norganizational promotions, introducing a small bias against women (R2 ¼ 0:01) resulted in only 35 percent of the top positions being filled by women, compared with 50 percent for an unbiased procedure (Martell et al., 1996). If any of the environmental variables examined in relation to age are taken into account in organizational decision making, one would expect a snowballing effect for age as well. Thus, even small effect sizes need to be meticulously estimated and quantified using meta-analysis. When the relationships are zero or negligible, establishing this in a rigorous meta-analytic cumulation can also serve the purpose of breaking up common cliche´s, erroneously held beliefs, and stereotypes of people at work. Hopefully, this is another contribution of this research.\r\n\r\nIf human economic activity is to achieve environmental sustainability, organizations must give every individual the opportunity, support, and encouragement to act in environmentally responsible ways. Such opportunities, support, and encouragement need to be provided to both younger and older workers. However, our findings also suggest that younger workers may need additional organizational interventions (e.g. training, explicit incentives) to encourage conserving and avoiding harm behaviors. Given the positive psychological consequences of engaging with nature (e.g. Kaplan and Talbot, 1983), they may also need help increasing their engagement in this regard. Managerial psychology has the opportunity to contribute to both the economic and environmental sustainability of organizations. We hope that the present study will be viewed among the first steps toward using psychological knowledge on demographic trends to this end.\"\r\n', NULL, 'Not enough details provided about the search.

It would be worthwhile to develop a universal protocol for REEI evaluations. These should describe the nature and quality of intervention measures, quantify the improvement in end energy, propose standardised analysis methods and include a set of quan- titative indicators for the reporting of outcomes. In acknowledge- ment of the importance of the householder perspective and context specific variables on outcomes, a common evaluation protocol should include guidelines for a qualitative inquiry. Common pro- cedureswould facilitate a more comprehensive synthesis of diverse programmes and provide a better picture of ‘what works’.\r\n\r\nWith regards to effective REEI design, we recommend that\r\nresidential energy improvement programmes should be tailored to the householder, ensure adequate ventilation and address summer and winter conditions. Intervention measures should give careful thought to smokers, gas stoves and radon exposure in the home. Although the awareness of the health risks of environmental to- bacco smoke permeated the selected literature, (Hopton and Hunt, 1996; Howden-Chapman et al., 2007; Iversen et al., 1986; Noris,2013; Osman et al., 2008; Pretlove et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2014b)) tobacco control, as implemented in rehousing for health interventions (e.g. (Takaro et al., 2001; Tuomainen et al., 2003)), was not reported in any of the selected programmes. While reducing indoor air pollutants from cooking may require a switch from gas to electric stoves (Paulin et al., 2014; Wilkinson et al., 2009), the mitigation of radon exposure when draught proofing radon affected dwellings necessitates mechanical ventilation sys- tems (Milner et al., 2014). In addition, REEIs should take into ac- count summer thermal comfort and the cost of cooling. In the context of climate change, ambient temperatures are expected to rise and the overheating of homes will present a likely health risk in the near future (Gupta and Gregg, 2012). \r\n\r\nLastly, we recommend to consider contextual factors to deter-\r\nmine what technical measures will be most effective in producing health benefits. Designing for adequate indoor temperatures without increasing household fuel costs means taking into consideration the take-back factor, energy price developments and the implications of new space conditioning systems. According to the physical thermodynamic model, this is more likely to be ach- ieved with comprehensive refurbishments than with isolated measures (Xing et al., 2011). The finding of this review that the scope of the improvement category did not necessarily predict the strength of the intermediate and final outcomes suggests that mechanisms other than the mere thermal improvement of the dwelling were at play. Hence, Part 2 of this realist review examines the influence of the contextual factors on the outcomes of resi- dential energy efficiency intervention.\"', NULL, '', 1, 35),

The cur- rent lack of consensus about what greenspace is should not deter researchers from using the term, but researchers should provide a meaningful definition that both qualifies and quantifies what they meant by the term. Future publications should employ clear opera- tional definitions based on measurable criteria in order to progress greenspace research.

In that respect, we recommend that greenspace is used as well as or instead of other terms that involve either of the identified interpretations found; that is, greenspace as natural areas or urban vegetation. This will allow the literature to be more distinct and meanings to be more widely understood. By using common terms and defining them well, an opportu-\r\nnity for meta-analyses presents itself.

It reveals that there are two major categories of green building incentives, namely external and internal incen- tives. External and internal incentives are different in their manner of motivation. External incentives can be categorised as either financial or non-financial and are extrinsic in nature, specifying the conditions or requirements that must be fulfilled by bene- ficiaries. In other words, external incentives involve project own- ers, and other stakeholders who are potential beneficiaries, in a forced choice. This is partly due to the major source of external incentives being the government, which has to follow due process. \r\n\\\r\nOn the other hand, the internal incentives (identified as\r\nincluding the human wellbeing related, market demand, gratify- ing, altruistic and persuasion and inspirational incentives) are intrinsic in nature, and are manifested as an appeal to the good will of stakeholders, especially project owners, and thus provoke their unforced interest in adopting green building practices. In short, there is no specificity of conditions before benefiting from internal incentive. Instead, project owners and other stakeholders alike adopt green building projects out of volition.\r\n\r\nIn terms of effectiveness, it is a confirmation that incentives,\r\nboth external and internal ones are important instruments for promoting green building, although it is not clear which one is more effective. Additionally owners are more incentivised into green building by the non-financial incentives than the financial incentives. Also evidence from the review suggests that the gov- ernment is moving in the direction of regulating green building as against incentivising it. The review uncovers some criticisms of green building incentives, mainly on external ones. They include the attachment of green building incentives to certification, lack of enforceability mechanism, and lack of mechanism to determine the optimum level of incentives required. Notably, these criticisms are significant because their manifestations discourage green building among owners, while it also leads to imprudence on the part of the government. Owners are discouraged by the accom- panying costs of meeting the conditions for benefiting from incentives. In particular, the commercial building owners are confronted with low demand because the incentives that encouraged them into green building are not transferrable to buyers or lessees. \r\n\r\nThe strategies for improving green building incentives were\r\nalso elicited from the review. Similar to the criticisms, the strate- gies largely concern the external incentives. One strategy, the private sector participation, emphasises on collaboration between the government and the private sector. Other strategies such as localising green building incentives require the government to redirect their approach to providing incentives so that owners can be more attracted and encouraged to pursue green building.\r\n\r\nThe findings of this review provide a number of implications\r\nfor the government. As the largest provider of external incentives, there is need for the government to adopt newer strategies that will make incentives provided to be more encouraging to the owners. Also, the government needs to address the gaps in the manner in which she administers incentives to the owners so as to sustain the reasons for providing the incentives in the first place, and to prevent loss of resources by the government themselves. The government should also seek to collaborate with the private sector in promoting green building. Evidence points to limited private sector participation, therefore, a collaborative effort by the government and private sector is significant towards promoting green building.\r\n\r\nThis review provided significant future research opportunities.\r\nIt is important to uncover the effectiveness of incentives in other countries, given that the findings of the effectiveness of incentives in this review are largely skewed to the United States and parts of Asia. In Europe and many parts of Asia and South Africa, green building practices have been strongly developed, and the use of incentives to promote green building practices is well advanced. It will be useful to know the effectiveness of incentives as instru- ments for promoting green building practices. This will also inform the generalisability of the effectiveness of incentives as instruments for driving green building projects. Also, as incentives, especially government incentives, incur a huge investment, it is important to appraise their effectiveness in order to justify con- tinuing investment. \\\r\n\r\nThe criticisms of incentives and strategies for improving government incentives, in this review are largely directed at external incentives. The reason is that the manifestation of internal incentives for green buildings is psychological – an area that is still growing in the literature. Many psychological and behavioural studies have been carried out on the related subject of energy efficiency, but not specifically green buildings. This suggests that a worthwhile approach will be to borrow these ideas as a means of robustly addressing the current criticisms of internal incentives for green buildings and associated strategies for improvement.\"\r\n', NULL, NULL, 1, 35),

This is compounded by the increased frequency, length and intensity of heat waves in the future predicted by a number of organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This paper has reported a critical review of liter- ature related to the consequences and strategies to respond to heat waves. It is found that even though there are a number of defini- tions of heatwaves, it is well recognized that a heatwave will often involve a combination of environmental factors (such as tempera- ture, humidity, radiation and wind speed) and social or cultural factors. With a projection of increased frequency, length and in- tensity of heatwaves in the future, the traditional definition of heat waves need to be revisited, followed by the re-consideration of associated impacts and measures. \r\n\r\nIn terms of impacts of heat waves, the review shows that vast\r\nmajority of existing studies played more focus on environmental issues such aswater quality, power consumption, peak demand and pollution; and health issues. Cost and social issues derived from heat waves are comparatively overlooked. Future studies are required to provide more evidence of cost and social impacts of heat waves to inform decision making.\r\n\r\nThe common mechanisms to deal with heat waves and the\r\nassociated consequences include: structural/institutional, techno- logical and cultural/behavioural. This study found that structural/ institutional and technological are two categories that attracted most attention in the literature whereas cultural/behavioural was paid less attention. This may attribute to the significant amount of resources (e.g. time) required to change the behaviour of residents and somewhat perceived intangible benefits. It is worth noting that these mechanisms are complementary with an ultimate goal to improve the resilience of urban and built environment to the climate change. Indeed, a proper combination of these mechanisms maylead to more effective measures to deal with heatwaves and its associated impacts. Effectiveness of these measures varies and is subject to the contextual factors such as cultural background, economic development level, etc. Future research opportunities exist to conduct empirical studies to develop a model for matching measures with contextual factors with a consideration of dynamic relationship amongst these factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well recognized that heatwaves have significant impacts on\r\nbuildings and infrastructures. Residential buildings should be given more focus in heat waves related research considering the amount of time residents stay at home. This is particular important for those groups more vulnerable to heat waves such as elder people and infants due to health implications. This review shows that there are limited studies on dwelling adaptation for heat waves. Indeed, it is highlighted in this study that the dwelling design plays a critical role for mitigating effects of heat waves. Future research opportunities exist to investigate the design options for dwellings as a response to heatwaves in future. Modelling the effectiveness of various design options with future climatic data will provide a useful reference to the future policy making and industry practice. This modelling exercise needs to take various factors into consid- eration such as: location, local climatic conditions, design modifi- cations and type of dwellings. Similarly, measures need to be taken into consideration for both those suitable for retro-fitting to an existing house and those that could be incorporated into a new house design. The cool retreat is proposed in this study as a critical component of modelling houses for future climate scenarios. \r\n\r\nIn addition, future research opportunity exists to prioritize the\r\nlarge number of risks associated with heat waves that are reported in this paper. One of common approaches is to analyse the proba- bility and severity of each individual risks (vide Martins et al., 2011). This helps policy makers to assign more resources to those risks with higher level of probability and severity.\"\r\n', NULL, 'The complete list of keywords or search strategy is not mentioned in the paper.\r\n\r\nSome organisational websites have been serach for literature.', 1, 35),

One important feature of validation studies is that they are often conducted for specific local traffic situations during relatively short time periods (hours, days). This means that these studies only partially validate traffic emission models. As a consequence, the information from a single study cannot be used for overall model evaluation. This leads us to conclude that, at present, there is inadequate under- standing of the uncertainties in traffic emission models and the main factors affecting prediction errors. Analysis of the available data revealed the use of six validation\r\ntechniques. The reported mean prediction errors are generally within a factor of 1.3 of observed values for CO2, within a factor of 2 for HC and NOx and within a factor of 3 for CO and PM.We found no evidence that more complex models perform systematically better in terms of prediction errors than simpler ones.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that current and new emission models\r\nincorporate the capability to quantify prediction errors, and that clear guidelines are developed by policy makers with respect to maximum allowable prediction errors.

Using a broad view of policy that captures the entwining of society-led and state-led climate change policy interventions, we examined how fine-grained characteristics of policies affect ex post cost, process, and problem effectiveness, as well as accountability implications. There are limits to our study. Evaluators do not choose policies\r\nto examine with an eye to obtaining full coverage of all policies in place that affect a problem; indeed, we observed differences in the evaluation results for academic versus grey literature, indicating that further work is needed to understand the reasons for these differences and their potential consequences (see also, Huitema et al., 2011). We also only examined policies that have been empirically evaluated. This means, our sample is skewed towards longer-standing policies and/or those that have produce informa- tion on their performance.\r\n\r\nStill, two key findings flow from the analysis. First, certain\r\npolicy characteristics are consistently associated with more positive evaluations. Built-in flexibility, defined time frames, and expenditure instruments all tended to result in more positive evaluations. Flexibility and expenditure instruments were deemed to minimize costs of achieving targets by allowing regulated actors to adopt a range of compliance options, whereas longer time frames stabilize expectations and reduce risks for regulated actors. Our qualitative assessment, however, highlighted how flexibility mechanisms were not always a guarantee of success and how longer time frames can present the risk of ‘‘locking’’ a country on particular policy pathways, as some suggest has occurred in the case of Germany and renewables (Frondel et al., 2008). Second, certain policy designs led to trade offs across the different evaluation criteria. Voluntary reporting mechanisms in the presence of costly emission reductions provided insufficient incentives for compliance on the part of firms, with limited expectations that this would promote the development or use of low carbon technologies. Those policies with hybrid sources of authority often resulted in more efficient ways in which to implement policy but tended to perform less well on effectiveness and accountability.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a contribution to filling a gap in existing knowledge, our\r\nanalysis also highlights issues that demand further research. Many of the studies noted the important interactions among policies – both government policies and those directed by NGOs and businesses – and began to identify conditions where such interactions were potentially beneficial or not (Mahapatra and Gustavsson, 2009; Skjærseth and Christiansen, 2006). These interactions require more systematic attention. Indeed, several of the studies we reviewed called for the need for a comprehensive approach to climate change governance, while also warning that new policies need to align with existing goals and policy styles in a given jurisdiction. The trade-offs we identified between evaluation criteria further complicate establishing a straightforward relation- ship between new or old policy interventions and desired outcomes. While counting the number of policies on an issue has been used as one proxy for evaluating the effectiveness of air pollution policies, including CO2 emissions (see Knill et al., 2012),\r\n\r\nour assessment supports more attention to the differential logics of policies operating alone and as mixes (Gunningham and Sinclair, 1999) and to the challenges of implementation and implications for accountability. This point is particularly relevant for the growing body of work\r\non climate change policy that seeks to understand how bottom-up processes of networked or interacting interventions – state-led and society-led at multiple scales – might prove effective (Hoffmann, 2011). This perspective is indicative of a different approach that takes a broad, more-networked view of the social, economic, political, and bureaucratic processes by which policy innovations with substantial consequences might come to exist. Here, the relevant issue for assessing lasting consequences is not just whether an individual policy is innovative, but how the aggregate effects of interacting policies perform to address the seemingly inherent trade-offs among effectiveness, efficiency, and account- ability apparent when examining single policies alone. Indeed, for a problem of the size and complexity of climate change, it is arguably the aggregate effect of new and old policy interventions across scales and jurisdictions that must be the focus of attention in order to understand how and whether innovation helps or hinders collective climate governance.\"\r\n', NULL, 'Some organisation databases have been searched, in addition to academic databases: \"international organizations (e.g., World Bank, UNEP, and OCED); and government reports (e.g., reports from the Auditor General’s office in Canada and equivalent in other countries)\".', 1, 35),

This paper aims to develop a systematic reviewof the development of green rating systems focusing on four well-known rating systems, namely BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE, and Green Star NZ to 1) discover how interest and research in green rating systems have developed; 2) identify the similarity, differ- ence, strength and weakness of green rating systems; 3) examine whether they fully assess the projects in all aspects of sustainability. The results indicate that green rating systems have become the\r\nfocus point of various researchers recently. Since 1998, 408 papers mentioned BREEAM, LEED, or CASBEE in E&B, B&E, A&C, BR&I, SBT&UD, CP, EIAR, R&SER while 202 of these papers focused on these ratings with a more in-depth approach. During the research period of 1998e2016, the number of green rating related papers\r\nrises sharply from only 2 to 36 on an annual basis. BREEAM is the first released green rating system in the world which certified\r\napproximately 560,000 buildings, but LEED is seen as the most flexible tool used in 160 countries and territories. In addition, there are a significantly higher number of papers discussing LEED compared to BREEAM concerning the eight main journal sources for this research since 1998. While the CASBEE and Green Star NZ related research papers are still limited. Green or sustainable building assessment is a global concern in both developed and developing countries. USA, Canada, the UK, China, and Australia have contributed up to approximately 70% of the total papers while Turkey, India, Brazil, and Malaysia are prominently considering green rating systems in their research schemes.\r\n\r\nThe similarity, difference, strength, and weakness of green rat-\r\ning systems were also identified based on the research manuals. The total categories, sub-categories, points, and mandatory credits tend to increase and more comprehensive in order to completely assess the sustainability of a project. LEED is the particular scheme in which the total points and mandatory credits were double in the version 4 since the version 2 besides the addition of two more categories. BREEAM is considered as the strongest rating system in which Environment and Society are carefully assessed along with the consideration in Economy and Institution. The weakest system could be Green Star NZ when it could only focus on one pillar of the sustainability, Environment. While Society is critically evaluated by LEED; and CASBEE is a well-balanced tool in Environment, Society, and Economy assessment.However, no rating scheme could assess a project in all aspects of sustainability. \r\n\r\nThis paper could be valuable for both green practitioners and\r\nresearchers to have an overall understanding of BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE and Green Star NZ. Categories, points, and mandatory credits were discussed in details to pinpoint the current status/ tendency of the green building rating systems. In addition, strengths and weaknesses of each rating system were also ana- lysed. Besides, the difference between New Construction and Neighbourhood Development/Communities/Urban Development were also examined to identify which sustainable pillars could be assessed by these tools. \r\n\r\nIt is recommended to include Economic and Institutional factors\r\nas supplementary assessment criteria and manuals for green building rating systems for a more comprehensive and through review of the project. Further research is needed to validate the impacts of adding Economic and Institutional factors to current green building certification systems. \r\n\r\nTo provide a better background knowledge of green rating systems, Interior Design, Building Operation and other manuals should be examined, but this research was only considered two main manuals, New Construction and Neighbourhood Development manuals. In addition, only recently CASBEE\'s manuals were ana- lysed because the previous ones are not in English. Furthermore, the examination in the four selected rating schemes may not reflect the overall trend of hundreds of schemes worldwide. These could be the limitations of this research.', '\"This paper is a significant upgrade to the paper “Green Building Assessment Schemes: A critical comparison among BREEAM, LEED, and Green Star NZ” presented at the International Conference on Sustainable Building Asia in South Korea on 11e14 December 2016.\"', 'Search and screening criteria were designed to pick up articles about a set of specific rating systems.', 1, 35),

However, as pointed out above, exactly what improvements should be made depend chiefly on the context and particularities of each targeted sample and individual motivations for using private motor vehicles. In some circumstances, improving accessibility may be enough, but in other circumstances where users are more emotionally attached to their private motor vehicles, other perceived qualityaspects mayneedtobeprovided. Some segments (e.g., travellers who have access to a car but choose to use PT) in a specific area may bemore sensitive to perceived attributes of PT service (less crowding, improved security, nicer stations and better user informa- tion,marketing and promotion) relative to physical attributes (higher speed, frequency and reliability).\r\n\r\nSustainable urban transport systems do not require complete eradication of private motor vehicles, but they must change the pattern of trade-offs among individual mobility, quality of life, environmental degradation and the undisputable convenience and emotional benefits that some individuals gain from private motor vehicle use. Encouraging modal shifts away from private cars to PT should always have the ultimate aim of contributing to a transport system (possibly comprising a variety of modes) that optimises temporal, price, environmental, social, and affective benefits and costs. Questions of sustainability are rarely solved with hard and fast answers, and more research and information are desirable. Discrete choice analyses may provide useful insight into understanding, and eventually influencing, travel mode choices. However, such analyses are only useful if user perspec- tives and values are first well-understood.\r\n\r\nThis study raises four issues that would benefit from further\r\nresearch. First, studies into the effect of improvements in the reliability of PT services would be a major contribution to this field of research. Second, more emphasis should be placed on perceived attributes when designing PT evaluation methods. Third, greater targeting of car users in future PT improvement studies would reveal more precisely what service attributes are attractive specifically to car users. And fourth, this field would benefit from more research into ways of enabling PT services to be perceived as having affective and symbolic value in addition to basic, instrumental worth. While examples from film and litera- ture show that travel by bus or train can have symbolic and emotional connotations, there exists little evidence in research to suggest that PT could emulate those emotional and status-based qualities that some value so strongly in private cars. If it was possible for car users to establish emotional and symbolic con- nections with PT, they might be more likely to shift away from regularly opting to use their private cars. Yet, this is no small task.\"\r\n', NULL, 'Unpublished studies also were included: \"In an attempt to locate unpublished studies, the literature search was extended to the following organisational sites: International Association of Public Transport (www.uitp.org), KonSULT (www.konsult.leeds.ac.uk), Planning and Transport Research Centre (www.patrec.org), European Local Transport Information Service (www.eltis.org), Federal Transit Administration (www.fta.dot.gov), and Victoria Transport Policy Institute (www.vtpi.org).

If disagreement arose between reviewers, the paper was referred to a third reviewer (BE) for assessment.\"', 11, 4, 0, '\"This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis assessing a\r\npossible association between residential greenness and allergic re- spiratory diseases in children and adolescents. For asthma, we found eight articles with two (1 ecological, 1 nested case-control) studies showing a protective effect of residential greenness, two (1 cohort, 1 nested case-control) studies showing a detrimental effect and four (1 ecological, 2 cohort, 1 cross-sectional) studies reporting no association. Our meta-analysis showed no significant overall association between residential greenness and asthma, but it was highly heterogeneous. Investigating allergic rhinitis we found five articles including a study of seven prospective birth cohorts. Again variable effects were found and our meta-analysis showed no significant overall association between residential greenness and allergic rhinitis. A key issue in these studies was the assessment and definition of the\r\noutcome. For asthma and allergic rhinitis the assessment varied from parental or self-report, to administrative records to clinical assessment. Questionnaire wording for the self-report outcome varied substantially and definition varied from ever having a doctor-diagnosis to symptoms or treatment in the last 12 months. This variation in the assessment of the outcome impacted on the ability to develop a cohesive body of evidence, treating as the same outcome resulted in high heterogeneity and inconsistent study results. The limited number of studies did not allow us to break down the outcome variables further. Another key issue is the measurement of the exposure. Nine studies\r\nused NDVI as the metric of residential greenness. In terms of global usability and comparability, NDVI is useful as it is a standardised global measure available at multiple time points. However it is a relatively crude measure when considering allergic outcomes, as it does not dis- tinguish between types of vegetation. The NDVI reported from a land- scape full of highly allergenic vegetation such as grasses and a relatively benign landscape may be identical, if the amount of green foliage is the same. Only one study used LiDAR imagery (Lovasi et al., 2013) to assess residential greenness. While standardised and globally applicable, un- like NDVI, LiDAR imagery is not freely available to the public and therefore not used by many investigators. The spatial buffer selected to measure residential greenness also\r\nvaried between studies with most choosing a buffer from 100m up to 59 km, generally a prior selection to represent either the immediate environment, the neighbourhood environment or the city\'s environ- ment. Furthermore, studies differed in how they scaled the effect esti- mates of residential greenness, with some giving estimates for an in- crease equal to the interquartile range of the data (Dadvand et al.,\r\n2014; Sbihi et al., 2015), others per standard deviation of the data (Lovasi et al., 2013), whilst others used a standardised 0.2 increase (Fuertes et al., 2016). Some studies chose to dichotomise their measure of residential greenness using cut point such as ‘above median’ (Andrusaityte et al., 2016). These factors made it difficult draw com- parisons across the different studies. Furthermore, residential greenness is a seasonal variable fluctuating\r\ngreatly in some areas of the world. This particularly impacts on satellite derived measures such as the NDVI. An NDVI calculated from images taken during the summer months could be vastly different to one cal- culated from images taken during winter/spring (Fig. S1, Didan, 2015). Only three of the nine studies utilising NDVI as a measure of greenness attempted to control for this factor by calculating monthly averages (Fuertes et al., 2014a) or calculating an average for the year (Sbihi et al., 2015, 2017). The remaining studies using NDVI calculated re- sidential greenness based on a single cloud free image for the each cohort/area. Spring (Dadvand et al., 2014; Pilat et al., 2012) and summer (Andrusaityte et al., 2016; Brokamp et al., 2016; Fuertes et al., 2016) were the most common seasons from which to calculate NDVI, although justification for the choice was rarely given. Even in the large study of seven cohorts (Fuertes et al., 2016) NDVI was calculated in different seasons across the included cohorts, with four cohorts (BAMSE, GINI +, LISA + and SAGE) being calculated during summer and three (CAPPS, MACS, PIAMA) during spring at birth. They also compared NDVI at ten years of age, again calculated from a single image taken during the autumn (BAMSE, PIAMA), summer (CAPPS, GINI +, LISA + and SAGE) or spring (MACS) months. This is a major problem due to the seasonality of greenness. Depending on the climatic conditions and vegetation profile there can be extreme differences in greenness between autumn and spring. While multiple images would be preferred, either averaged or as repeated measures, studies could have considered adjusting for season or time of outcome measure. Seasonality of exposure measurement is particularly important\r\nwhen considering other environmental factors such as pollen. High pollen levels have been linked to an increase in paediatric ED pre- sentations for asthma (Darrow et al., 2012; Erbas et al., 2012; Gleason et al., 2014; Ito et al., 2015) and hospital admissions (Chen et al., 2016). Early exposure to high pollen levels has also been implicated in the development of allergic respiratory disease (Erbas et al., 2013) and increased risk of asthma hospitalisation (Lowe et al., 2012). Pollen types and concentrations vary widely depending on location, season and meteorological conditions (D\'Amato et al., 2007) and therefore could potentially explain some of the variation reported. While intact pollen grains, being 10–100 µm in diameter depending on the species, only penetrate into the airways in small amounts (Driessen and Quanjer, 1991), pollen allergens are also released in starch granules which being smaller, are much more readily inhaled (Bacsi et al., 2006; Visez et al., 2015). No study adjusted analysis based on level or type of pollen or included it as potential effect modifier. Distance to roads should also be considered when investigating re-\r\nsidential greenness. Trees along roadsides can trap air pollution and decrease the air quality in the immediate vicinity (Vos et al., 2013). Only one study (Sbihi et al., 2015) adjusted for distance to highways and major roads. Despite finding no significant interaction, the pro- tective effect of residential greenness was enhanced in models including distance to highways and major roads. The granules of pollen released along major roadways bind to airborne particles such as diesel-exhaust (Behrendt and Becker, 2001). This interaction with air pollution in- creases the risk of sensitisation and exacerbations within children who are sensitised (D\'Amato et al., 2007). The immune response to the al- lergen can also be modified by traffic related air pollutants (Fröhlich- Nowoisky et al., 2016). While fine particulate matter can change the allergen presentation, gaseous pollutants can increase inflammatory and immune responses to allergens (Sénéchal et al., 2015). Four studies (Fuertes et al., 2014b; Pilat et al., 2012; Sbihi et al., 2015, 2017) con- trolled or adjusted for some form of traffic related air pollution. As with proximity to roads, Sbihi and colleagues (Sbihi et al., 2015) showed an enhanced protective effect of residential greenness when NO, NO2 or PM2.5 was included in the model. The difference between planned urban vegetation and diverse wild\r\nvegetation is a key component of the biodiversity hypothesis of allergy (Haahtela et al., 2013). Two of the studies considered the impact of urbanisation on residential greenness (Fuertes et al., 2014b, 2016). The study of two German cohorts split into geographical areas with GINI/ LISA South being metropolitan and GINI/LISA North being more rural (Fuertes et al., 2014b) also found different effects with a decrease in odds of allergic rhinitis and atopic sensitisation present in the rural area and not the metropolitan. The interaction between the urban/rural regions within these studies and NDVI was significant and remained after adjustment for modifiers. Due to the heterogeneity of outcomes and exposures measured and\r\nthe small number of studies investigating residential greenness and allergic respiratory disease, only limited meta-analyses could be con- ducted. Differences in the age range of participants between studies contributed to the heterogeneity, with some studies not reporting age strata (Pilat et al., 2012). The sample size of the included studies varied significantly with some being quite small e.g. 11 (Pilat et al., 2012). In addition to the different measures used; NDVI at different buffers, LiDAR and street tree counting, the timing of measurement varied greatly within studies. Some considered greenness around the home ‘at birth’, generally within one or two years of child\'s birth, while others considered time of the outcome measurement. A standardised global\r\nEnvironmental Research 159 (2017) 212–221\r\nmeasure of greenness – be it NDVI or percentage green space derived from LiDAR imaging – at a set buffer, during an appropriate time period, would have created a more cohesive body of evidence allowing for the greater examination of the effect of residential greenness on allergic respiratory diseases. In summary, had we better exposure measures that considered po-\r\ntentially critical environmental confounders, we would have a better understanding of the role of residential greenness to allergic respiratory disease in children and adolescents. Further evidence of an effect of residential greenness may provide better insights into how better to manage day to day asthma and allergic diseases. With substantial po- pulation growth and migration to developed countries, more and more people are living in urbanised areas. Attention needs to be paid not just to the aesthetic qualities of the built environment, but the implications on public health when developing housing and surrounding green spaces.\"', '\"Michael Abramson holds investigator initiated research grants from\r\nPfizer and Boehringer-Ingelheim for unrelated research.

This review drew on the best available quantitative and qualitative evidence on changes in health outcomes as well as changes in determinants of health. A logic model mapping the reported health impacts and pathways to health impacts and so- cio-economic impacts following housing improvement generally has been prepared (Figure 10). It would appear that provision of adequate and affordable space and warmth are key determinants of subsequent health and health impacts, in particular respiratory health. The extent of health improvement reported will depend on the extent of improvement in actual housing conditions expe- rienced by householders.Health improvement ismost likely if the housing improvements are targeted at those in most need, that is those living in poor housing and with existing poor health. The nature of available evidence prevents estimates of effect size to be calculated.\r\nOther impacts associated with improved thermal comfort and af- fordable warmth are linked to an effective increase in house size by increasing usable space. Increased usable space can promote im- provements in diet, privacy, household and family relationships, as well as opportunities for leisure and studying. Improvements in health following warmth improvements may also lead to reduced absences from school or work.\r\nThe health impacts of housing improvements delivered across a whole area or neighbourhood, rather than targeted according to individual household need, are less clear. Area based interventions may involve awider range of housing improvements, ranging from a new kitchen to rehousing, and often these programmes will in- clude warmth improvements. However, area based programmes do not discriminate between those in most need. This together with the wide range in the extent of housing improvement deliv- eredmeans that evaluations reporting impacts for the programme may not detect the possible benefits experienced by subgroups of households with the greatest potential to benefit.\r\nChanges inhousing costsmay be associatedwith housing improve- ment. Improvements in energy efficiencymay reduce fuel use but changes in spending on fuel are also influenced by the unit cost of fuel, which has risen significantly in recent years. Rent is usually directly linked to housing quality, and rent will often increase to reflect housing upgrades. For those on lowincomes these increases may be covered bywelfare provision.There ismixed evidence from studies with regard to impacts on housing costs and disposable income. Area based programmes of housing-led renewal often in- corporate wider neighbourhood improvements and may lead to reductions in reported neighbourhood problems. Increased hous- ing costs may prevent the full potential for housing improvement to generate health impacts to be realised.\r\nEvidence from LMICs and historical studies of rehousing from slums is limited both in quantity and quality.Despite the different interventions and contexts there may still be lessons to be learnt fromthese studies to support the development of a broad theory of housing conditions and health. There is little evidence of adverse impacts following housing improvement, with the exception of where the improvement was followed by a considerable increase in rent.\r\nIt may be disappointing that the evidence for the health benefits following housing improvement is not more conclusive. The ev- idence in this review relates to the effectiveness of housing im- provement programmes rather than the efficacy of improved hous- ing conditions on health. Evidence of effectiveness relates to the health impacts which can be expected following implementation of a housing improvement programme, whether or not the pro- gramme did lead to actual improvements in housing conditions for occupants. The evidence of effectiveness of housing improve- ment programmes is inconclusive, and itmay be that the potential for improved housing conditions to lead to health impacts may be greater than indicated in the evaluation of housing improve- ment programmes. There are three possible explanations for this. It is possible that real improvements in housing conditions were not experienced by those receiving the intervention. Delivery of a housing improvement cannot be assumed to lead to improved housing conditions for occupants. For example, following delivery of a housing improvement the potential for a housing outcome, such as warmth, to be improved may be countered by concerns about costs, confusion about operating a new heating system, etc., or it may be that the baseline housing conditions were already adequate. Secondly, the greatest potential for health improvement is among those with existing poor health. Where a population mostly has good health, it will limit the potential for a programme of housing improvement to lead to significant improvements in health status.Thirdly,many of the housing interventions delivered are widely available for householders to implement themselves, independent of a housing programme. Much of the evidence re- viewed here compares those who were part of a housing improve- ment programme, the intervention group, with those who were not, the control group. Where householders who were not part of the housing improvement programme initiated their own housing improvement during the study this is ’contamination’. Contami- nation of the control group limits the value of comparing the two groups and makes it more difficult to detect the actual impact of the housing programme. The inconclusive evidence of health im- pacts following housing improvement may be a result of housing improvement programmes that do not deliver tangible improve- ments in housing conditions to those with existing health condi- tions. These issues further underline the need to target households in greatest need and ensuring the intervention delivers tangible improvements in housing conditions if the potential for health improvement following housing improvement is to bemaximised.\r\nThe evidence reviewed here does not shed any light on the poten- tial for housing improvement programmes on health inequalities. Most of the studies were of low income groups with poor health, and improving living standards and health for these groups is de- sirable. However, reducing the gap in health outcomes or life ex- pectancy between affluent and deprived groups implies that health outcomes in the worse off groups will improve at a faster rate than among affluent groups.This requires data on the changes in health outcomes across groups.We did not identify studies with suitable data.\"', NULL, 'A comprehensive list of search terms used with different search databases are given in Appendix 7.

To limit these results to those papers that would be most relevant, the search was further limited to the terms being found in the article title, abstract or key words in the social sciences and humanities subject area. This returned 125 hits. FromFrom this list, papers that met three inclusion criteria were selected. First, selected publications had to address whether environmental sustainability was being achieved. This included research that looked at the success of efforts for achieving environmental sustainability generally and studies that looked at a specific plan, policy or initiative. These policies comprised any area that the authors considered important for environmental sustainability, including water, agriculture and conservation, as well as the environmental impacts of other initiatives such as housing, tourism and transport. Second, selected publications had to identify some kind of failure. This included failing to achieve environmentally sustainable outcomes with current and past initiatives, as well as predicted failings of future initiatives. It also included papers that were developing tools to overcome failings or used predictive models to identify scenarios in which environmental sustainability would or would not be met. A policy was determined to have failed if it did not achieve its environmental objectives (as summarised in the introduction to this paper). Finally, selected publications had to identify the cause or causes of the policy failure. These criteria produced a list of 94 articles in total.', 94, 1, 1, '\"More than two decades have passed since the comprehensive international commitment to pursue\r\nsustainable development. Despite the global reach of policies originating from the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the state of the global environment has continued to deteriorate. Hence, it is clear that these policies have not been sufficient for achieving the goals of sustainability. This paper reviewed 94 different studies on the failure to improve environmental sustainability from many different regions of the world, including both developed and developing countries. Some studies focused on specific cases or policies, others took a more general approach. What is clear from this review is that the inability to improve environmental sustainability is due to a complex number of causes and a significant element is policy implementation failure from the international to the national, regional and local levels of government. The reasons for this failure are a complex set of interrelated structural causes, implementation traps and knowledge/scoping issues. While the specific reasons for individual policy failures are many and varied, three key factors\r\nwere recurring. First, there are ongoing economic incentives (supported by policy) for private and public activities to continue to exploit natural resources without deeper consideration of the associated damage to the environment. Second, governments either do not have the capacity and/or the political will to implement effective sustainability policies. Third, the seriousness of sustainability issues and the urgent need for change have not been effectively communicated to key stakeholders. These three factors are mutually reinforcing and suggest that there has been a failure to convince decision-makers in all sectors that sustainable development offers a realistic pathway to a prosperous economy, a better society, and a healthy environment. There are key differences between developed and developing countries with regards to the relative influence of various types of causal factors that lead to policy implementation failures. Developing countries, for example, will face additional challenges with regards to the capacity of their public sector to catalyse change. This means that implementation strategies must be tailored to suit individual situations if they are to be effective. Having said all this, the past policy implementation failures detailed in the studies that have\r\nbeen reviewed do not indicate that achieving environmental sustainability is impossible [124]. They simply catalogue what has gone wrong with attempts to bring about the necessary change so far. If policy-makers learn from these mistakes, they may still be able to set society on a sustainable development path. The past cannot be changed, but the future is still open for negotiation.\"\r\n6.', 'The authors declare no conflict of interest.\r\nReferences', 'No specific search string has mentioned.', 1, 34),

The review highlighted that studies have not covered all elements in the complex system of resource saving sufficiently, particularly human behaviour, and study results are often not communicated clearly for them to be transferable or implementable. In addition, there are not enough interdisciplinary studies that combine complex interactions between the built environment, technology, climate, and behaviour, with industry knowledge to stimulate the required sustainability?oriented innovation. More research is required to study different accommoda- tion types and locations, water saving, guest involvement, and longi- tudinal measurement. To advance research in a more coherent way, a framework has been proposed that recognises the connections between goals, saving approaches, key influencers, and outcomes. This will enable greater coherence of research in this field to support collaborative networks, between universities and firms, to develop radical service innovation that is sustainability?oriented.', NULL, NULL, NULL, 35);

However, we need further research and more detailed information on the characteristics of the green and blue spaces that promote better mental health (quantity, quality and distance) and the mechanisms, which are highly related to the use of these spaces. Future studies should also include stratified analyses according to social class, education, age and gender, as they possibly could modify the beneficial health effects of green and blue spaces. In terms of comparability, future studies are recommended to use NDVI as marker of surrounding greenness or use a well- established definition of percentage of green space. Regarding the evaluation of access to major green spaces (?0.05 km2) studies should conduct sensitivity analyses using other distances than the current recommended distance (300 m), as there is no evidence that this distance is actually determinant for the beneficial health effects of green spaces. There is still a big debate on whether studies should use the Euclidian or the network distances to evaluate access to green spaces; the first is used in most guidelines and studies and is easier to calculate. However, the second might be more realistic in relation to walked distances and the ease of access. As there is not a consensus yet, we propose to evaluate both where possible.\r\nFinally, it would be interesting in future studies to adjust the models assessing residential greenness and mental health for the greenness at school (children) and at work (adults), as we daily spend an important part of our time in these places.

This can be resolved by a set of policy measures that internalize negative externalities such as GHG emissions...\r\n....The methodology discussed in this paper aims at internalizing\r\nthe GHG effectiveness of specific transport measures included in urban mobility plans, by quantifying their economic benefits and implementation costs. The real challenge, however, is to find a reliable value of carbon emission among the many estimates pro- vided by the economic literature. The model described in Section 3 is based on a meta-analysis of approximately 700 studies; the most significant parameters can be selected to explain the many values of GHG emissions. The results may be used to predict the final GHG economic price at the base of many policy and regulatory contexts, based on the main variables chosen. This method was investigated to calculate the benefits of adopting specific measures, as taken from an energetic plan such as SEAP. This outcome can be compared with other transport impacts e normally included in the evaluation process e to determine a fairer impact of the measures.\r\nBy developing this methodology, some progress has been made\r\nin reducing the polar values found in the literature and in defining a methodological framework to internalize GHG emissions. SUMPs and all innovative forms of mobility plans can adopt this replicable and scalable method in their evaluations by introducing the appropriate modifications. This must have some potential uses: in the long run, carbon interest will undoubtedly shape future transport patterns and the provision of private, public and freight transport services, despite the key drawbacks of the methodology used and the large uncertainty of carbon emissions.\"', NULL, 'There is no screening criteria and search string mentioned.

Based on these results, we conclude that despite heterogeneous treatment effects, non-monetary, information-based strategies can be effective at reducing overall energy usage in controlled experimental studies. This is an important finding, because it suggests that information and education programs targeting conservation through behavioral change should be considered alongside with efforts to reduce energy consumption through technological improvements. As the advent of new technologies such as smart meters reduces the cost of feedback and increases the quality and reliability of information provided, policy makers would be well-served to shift some means to these high-impact, relatively low-cost information programs, which can result in real savings. \r\n\r\nWhile this meta-analysis suggests that information strategies\r\ninduce energy conservation, it is less clear which strategies work best, in part because many experiments simultaneously use more than one strategy leading to confounding issues and also because of the lack of methodological sophistication of some of the studies. To better identify the winning strategies, additional experiments are needed. Such experiments should learn from the previous literature by following a few guiding principles with regard to the methodological rigor. Sound experiments in energy conservation should use dedicated control groups, take sufficient baseline measurements and control for weather and demographic char- acteristics. It is also advisable to isolate individual strategies to assess their added value. The field could also benefit from studies of longer duration and larger sample size. With the continuing deployment of smart meters across the world, there are new and exciting opportunities to test information-based strategies for energy conservation.

Information also seems to be a crucial factor in forming preferences given that citizens who are well informed about the uncertainties that characterize GE production are more supportive than those who are not well informed.\r\nThese results suggest that in the future, WTP for GE could positively change, and in fact, the end of the economic downturn combined with a carefully designed and detailed information campaign could facilitate target achievement.\r\nWith respect to policy implications, our findings support the view that, worldwide, the existing consensus regarding the development of RES use in electricity production is appreciable.\r\nIn monetary value, this consensus is estimated to range from 23% to 72% of investment required to achieve the global policy scenario labeled as WSS.\r\nGiven that average data hide existing differences among continents and countries with respect to income, GE consumption, lifestyle and resource endowments, unearthing these differences requires a deep analysis that focuses on regional differences.\"', NULL, NULL, NULL, 35),

To the theoretical aspects, new BIM tools need to be developed for assessing related sustainability criteria throughout the project\'s life cycle, including the materials used and energy- consumption aspects. On the one hand, an innovative procure- ment system needs to be formulated to adapt the social sustain- ability in the project. On the other hand, practical implications need to streamline the BIM uses into the aspects of demolition and refurbishment, and also to improve the interoperability issue among BIM software and energy-simulation tools. Ultimately, a unified approach is required by integrating BIM technologies with all sustainability aspects.\r\nFuture policies of BIM for sustainability should consider and adopt the above-mentioned implications. For instance, the new or revised BIM standards and guidelines should include a set of re- quirements on the BIM tools to comply with a standard sustain- ability assessment. The assessment should make clear the specifications of building materials and energy modelling used in the project. Some specifications include material properties calcu- lation, carbon estimation, hazardous substances evaluation, and material sustainability assessment. The energy modelling should provide the criteria for sun controls, natural ventilation, daylighting, and other energy simulations. In terms of the social sustainability aspect, BIM standards and guidelines should include elements of relational contracting in the project delivery system, especially for public involvement and other downstream project stakeholders.

In fact, they are also strong performers of the real estate market. Using regression analyses in conjunction with other techniques, literature found that green office buildings do command rental price premium over the comparable non-green office buildings. The strong market performance of green office building was not only influenced by a single attribute. Rather, it was a result of complex interaction between various attributes. Result of the meta-analysis confirms that attributes like certification, locational, building characteristics, and lease contract features had a strong influence on the rental prices of green buildings. Nevertheless, literature could not fully explain the reasons behind the rental price premium. One of the possible reasons for this is literature’s adopted analytical methods and variables that are similar to the studies on non-green office building performances. Moreover, the certification effect was indeed relatively smaller compared to the other attributes. All these indicate that there would be another reasons for the premium. In fact, when considering the uniqueness of the green buildings, assessing its market performance may require a different approach. As Ledgerwood [32] suggested, consideration on both “tangible” (e.g. building height, size) and (ii) its “symbolic” (e.g. intangible benefits from the green image) aspects would provide a better indication on properties’ prices. To this extent, analysis on the green buildings’ lucrative price tag might require consideration on its “special meanings” to its users which need to be further investigated.

Although meta-analysis in this research is very useful as it combines already existing data from different studies, the result of the analysis might be influenced by unique nature of each study.

These do not necessarily involve additional cost but do require more thoughtful planning: for example design improvements such as bet- ter selection of control areas, or statistical methods such as the use of propensity score analysis for managing confounding76–78.

Additionally, evaluation of policies being implemented is a form of monitoring how well an intervention is contributing towards the outcome predicted in a model. In reality, the empirical evidence, in the area of health co-benefits of transport policies, is so limited that it fails to provide this foundation.

Technological and economic, political and institutional, and social and individ- ual factors and dynamics tend to create stable equilibria that may be suboptimal for planetary health but are difficult to disrupt. The realms of infrastructure and technology, institutions, and individual behaviors contain distinct but parallel dynamics that favor existing carbon-intensive technologies and development paths. Lock-in in each of these realms and the global-scale sys- temic lock-in that emerges because of their mutual reinforcement pose significant obstacles to adoption of less-carbon-intensive technologies and development paths. This article has reviewed current understandings of the conditions under which and reasons why such lock-in emerges among the distinct system components we have identified as well as at the higher system level. Current understandings of lock-in demonstrate that lock-in is highly likely because of uninten- tional features of these systems as well as because powerful actors often benefit from creating and maintaining a state of lock-in. Those actors lobby for policies that reinforce initial movements toward lock-in.\r\nUnderstanding how and when lock-in emerges also helps identify windows of opportunity at which transitions to alternative technologies and paths are possible. Such transitions prove easier to accomplish when the costs of transitioning to an alternative are low. Systems can be more plastic, and hence more open to low-carbon-intensive choices, either in emergent realms and sectors where no technology or development path has yet become dominant and locked-in or at moments when locked-in realms and sectors are disrupted by technological, economic, political, or social changes that reduce the costs of transition or make relevant actors more willing to incur those costs.\"', NULL, 'No details of methodology used', NULL, 35),

As in any study, our research work is not exempt fromlimitations. The main restriction relates to the realization of SLR itself, since the process of refining studies, inclusion criteria, and sources of exclusion are not immune to subjectivity and bias. However, the SLR synthesis provided a new and more comprehensive perspective on the subject, which were not achievable from the appraisal of the results of each study in isolation. Prior works have focused mostly on identifying LT and sustainability benefits, synergies,\r\nand trade-offs. Our framework provides a holistic view of LT and sustainability integration to assist decision-makers in the construction industry. To our knowledge, this is a novel study, which advances the prescription of LT elements as catalysts of sustainability over a building’s lifecycle according to synergies identified in published evidence. We found that the published studies have different positions about the integration and synergies\r\nbetween LT and sustainability concepts. However, most papers converge over the idea that LT and sustainability focuses on waste reduction and maximum value generation. Other studies show that adopting LT elements does not necessarily improve and may even harm environmental performance. These contradictions might be explained by the fact that sustainability is strongly influenced by decisions made during conception and design, while LT has still mainly focused on the construction stage of projects by the prescription of lean techniques and tools. Another possible explanation stems from the fact that LT-oriented customers have sometimes a different mindset compared to sustainability-oriented ones. While LT focuses on meeting the customer’s values whatever they may value, the sustainability envisions value generation to society, perceived as a broader potential customer. The evaluation of previous work also shows a gap in research about the social and economic\r\nlines of inquiry.

This goal was identified in response to the urgent need to consider new approaches to motivating individuals to become more energy aware and to translate this knowledge into action. It has been identified that it is essential to consider macro- and micro-level variables that may influence household consumption patterns [51]. The evidence sum- marised in the current review provides encouraging initial evidence that applied games can have a positive influence in the domestic energy conservation domain, but overall this review provides a good founda- tion for further work as opposed to conclusive evidence. Several key areas of focus for future work emerge from the current\r\nreview. Firstly, there is a need for more quantitative empirical research. Understandably, given the relative youth of the area of focus, much of the existing research is exploratory in nature. More specifically, there is a clear need for studies that isolate the impact of applied games (e.g., RCTs, quasi-experimental studies) in comparison to no intervention and more traditional interventions. Similarly, there is a need for qualitative research that more clearly identifies people\'s thoughts and motivations in relation to potential energy conservation interventions. Secondly, a number of more specific questions remain unanswered. It is not yet known how the impact of applied games varies across different user groups, nor is it possible to know which game elements are most effective. Thirdly, it is important that research explores the effectiveness of applied games over a longer timeframe. Finally, while user experience is a key element of applied games, research that goes beyond this outcome to include cognitive, learning and behavioural measures will greatly strengthen understanding of the field. It can be concluded that applied games generally provide a positive\r\nuser experience with all studies reporting positive impacts on this outcome. With respect to cognitive outcomes, there is consistent evidence of improved attitudes towards and awareness of energy conservation issues. In almost all studies, applied games appear to lead to improvements in self-reported and actual energy conservation behaviour but it is not yet clear whether these changes persist long- term. With respect to knowledge and learning, applied games appear to be effective means of improving general knowledge of energy con- sumption and conservation, but it is less clear that they are effective for communicating more specific knowledge. Overall, there is emerging evidence of the value of applied games as a means of reducing domestic energy consumption with further research needed to answer key outstanding questions.\"\r\n', NULL, NULL, 1, 35),

This paper suggests that built environment characteristics from three domains (transportation systems, land use patterns, and urban design) can impact both functional limitations and disability in positive and negative directions. However, it is still unclear if these associations represent direct influences on the disablement process. The most promising evidence points to high density of intersections, street and traffic conditions, and proximity to select destinations and green space as the most likely factors to impact mobility, though results have been incon- sistent. These inconsistencies are likely due to differences in methodology. There are many differences between studies regarding neighborhood definition, exposure measurements, and outcome assessment.\r\n....For this field to advance, research must have a strong\r\ntheoretical framework, identify associations of the built envi- ronment with incident mobility restrictions, assess how changes in the built environment affect mobility, and char- acterize subpopulations among which these associations are strongest, areas that have not been adequately addressed in previous research. In general, effect sizes of associations between built environment characteristics and functioning in older adults are small to moderate. However, a large per- centage of the population is exposed to these conditions, indicating that the potential public health impact of policy interventions could be great [48]. The advantage of popula- tion level interventions over those that target only high-risk individuals has been demonstrated [49, 50]. In general, older adults wish to age in place, remaining in their homes rather than moving to potentially more accommodating locations [51]. In order to facilitate aging in place and maintaining quality of life as people age, it is important to understand the role of the built environment on mobility limitations and disabilitywhile addressing the limitations of the current body of evidence.\"', 'Not mentioned in the paper ', 'There is no search string mentioned in the paper.', 1, 35),

Notwithstanding their usefulness and wide application, indicator-based methods face some limitations (Manuel-Navarrete et al., 2007).

Although this paradigm has made important contributions to the understanding of urban vulnerability, it tends to ignore other equally fundamental dimensions and determi- nants; to produce a set of explanatory variables that are tightly constrained by the availability of data, particularly in developing countries; and it omits any attempt to gain ethnographic knowledge of behavioral norms, social networks and risk perceptions that are equally relevant to understanding urban vulnerability. The dominance of the urban vulnerability as impact paradigm suggests that more studies should be undertaken that apply the and temporal scales, providing valuable information on a particular context but lacking an ability to move beyond case studies and uncover broader trends in temperature–mortality linkages.\r\nWithout a doubt, a more integrated approach to the multiple dimensions and determinants of urban vulnerability is needed. Some efforts within each research paradigm have been undertaken to converge with other traditions. However, as illustrated by this paper, scholars in the area of urban vulnerability tend to be narrowly focused. In order to improve our state of our knowledge, it is fundamental to move beyond disciplinary boxes and create more inclusive efforts aimed at shedding light on areas currently in the shadows and on developing more interdisciplinary and integrated approaches. The central understanding of this integrat- ed approach will be that what each paradigm can shed light on only a small piece of a complex puzzle. Understanding the nature of urban vulnerability will require\r\nnovel approaches at integrating the disciplinary threads our science. Our meta-analysis and meta-knowledge method is an attempt to move us towards an understanding of the nature of and the interactions between hazards, and their drivers, exposure, sensitivities, adaptive capacities, actual adaptations and their determinants. The interdisciplinary knowledge that may be gained through studies such as this one, will aid in the design and implementation of more effective adaptation actions in this increasingly urban world.\"', NULL, 'Search String is clearly elaborated in table 1.

by comparison, petroleum refineries have many smaller and lower concentration sources. Since the iron and steel and refining industries both considered the use of post combustion amine capture, there is the potential for shared learning of the use of the technology on low quality sources. Costs throughout the time period considered in the model were found to fall within the range of $20-70 per tonne of CO2 avoided, with costs in 2050 lower due to the effect of increased learning making technologies cheaper than when first deployed. From this model, the cement industry has the lowest estimated mean costs of deployment over the entire time period considered at $28 per tonne of CO2 avoided through utilisation of a calcium looping sys- tem, with the cost falling to $20 per tonne avoided by the end of the studied period. By comparison, the use of a more mature tech- nology, post-combustion amine absorption, was found to be the most cost effective strategy for deployment on the iron and steel\r\nindustry and on petroleum refineries, but with higher projected mean costs over the time period; approximately $55 for the iron and steel industry and $59 for refineries, with final costs at the end of the study period in 2050 of $40 and $43 per tonne avoided respec- tively. Alternative technological options for each of the industries were also investigated, including oxyfuel combustion or mineral carbonation, but the data from these technologies was either very sparse or inconsistent, leading to greater uncertainty over costs.\r\nFrom the sensitivity analysis, it can be seen that the factors with the greatest effect on the overall avoided cost of CO2 are the start date, the learning cost reduction and the initial cost per tonne avoided from literature. The large effect caused by the base cost from literature demonstrates the necessity for a clear and consis- tent method of reporting costs than can be easily compared in order to draw firmer conclusions about the costs associated with CCS. What is readily apparent is that the large-scale deployment of CCS required to meet the emissions reduction targets of 80% by 2050 will be expensive, but that costs will only increase if deployment is delayed.\r\nEven with deployment on 80% of plants by 2050, the cumulative emissions over the time period is very low, accounting for only 25% of emissions for the iron and steel industry or the cement industry, and 16% for the refining industry, which could potentially impact carbon budgets due to the low mitigation across the time period considered. In order to reduce cumulative emissions further, an earlier start date or a faster rate of deployment would be required.\r\nAlso important is the learning cost factor, which can lead to a 40–50% increase in costs if cost reductions are half as great as expected. Combined with the potential for a 80% increase in the event of the high growth rate scenario compared to the steady growth scenario, there exists a great deal of uncertainty sur- rounding future costs of carbon capture and storage as applied to industrial plants.

The resulting interdisciplinary research addresses the benefits that ecosystems can provide for urban citizens through urban green spaces.

Using more data and more advanced statistical analysis, this paper confirms the findings of Tol (2005) that estimates of the social cost of carbon are driven to a large extent by the choice of the discount rate and equity weights; and that the more pessimistic estimates have not been subject to peer review. This paper also offers four new results. Firstly, there is a downward trend in the estimates of the social cost of carbon—even if the IPCC (Schneider et al. 2007) would like to believe the opposite. Secondly, the Stern Review (Stern et al. 2006) is an outlier—and its impact estimates are pessimistic even when compared to other studies in the gray literature and other estimates that use low discount rates. Thirdly, the uncertainty about the social cost of carbon is so large that the tails of the distribution may dominate the conclusions (Weitzman 2007b)—even though many of the high estimates have not been peer- reviewed and use unacceptably low discount rates. Fourthly, if everyone were to pay a carbon price equal to the social cost of carbon (but not reduce emissions much, as they cannot in the short-term), there is a fair chance that annual taxes would exceed annual income for many people. If the carbon price is a liability, this would imply bankruptcy. If the carbon price is a tax, this would imply complete collectivisation of the economy.\r\n\r\nThere are three implications. Firstly, greenhouse gas emission reduction today is justified. Even the most conservative assumption lead to positive estimates of the social cost of carbon (cf. Table 1) and the Pigou tax is thus greater than zero. Yohe et al. (2007) argue that there is reason to reduce greenhouse gas emissions further than recommended by cost-benefit analysis. The median of the Fisher-Tippett kernel density for peer-reviewed estimates with a 3% pure rate of time preference and without equity weights, is $20/tC. This compares to a price of carbon permits of $160/tC in the European Union,8 and a zero price in most of the rest of the world. The case for intensification of climate policy outside the EU can be made with conservative assumptions. One does not have to rely on speculation as in Schneider et al. (2007) or dodgy analysis as in Stern et al. (2006). At the same time, current EU climate policy seems to fail the cost-benefit test unless one puts a heavy emphasis on risk and uses a very low discount rate (cf. Tol, 2007, for a more detailed discussion). Secondly, the uncertainty is so large that a considerable risk premium is warranted. With the conservative assumptions above, the mean equals $23/tC and the certainty-equivalent $25/tC. More importantly, there is a 1% probability that the social cost of carbon is greater than $78/tC. This number rapidly increases if we use a lower discount rate—as may well be appropriate for a problem with such a long time horizon—and if we allow for the possibility that there is some truth in the scare-mongering of the gray literature. Thirdly, more research is needed into the economic impacts of climate change—to eliminate that part of the uncertainty that is due to lack of study, and to separate the truly scary impacts from the scare-mongering. Papers often conclude with a call for more research, and often this is a call for funding for the authors or a justification for further papers by the authors. In this case, however, quality research by newcomers in the field would be particularly welcome.\"', NULL, 'Does not explain the search and screening methods.', 1, 35),

This paper has attempted to quantify these benefits at a national scale. Combining benefit transfer meth- ods and detailed GIS data on a number of UK cities, per household changes in benefits are identified and extrapolated for England,Wales and Scotland for the six NEA scenarios. This analysis shows that changes in the provision of urban greenspace can create, or destroy, billions of pounds worth of benefits to local residents. The analysis also presents a methodology for estimating the spatial distribution of gains\r\nand losses arising fromwell specified policy changes. It therefore provides an important tool for the analysis of policies varying the amount, location and accessibility of urban greenspace and is integrated alongside impacts on other ecosystem services in the analysis of land use change scenarios presented in Bateman et al. (2013a). We conclude by acknowledging some of the caveats of our analysis. First, a number of the benefits people derive from urban ecosystem services could not or\r\nonly partially be considered in our analysis. For example the benefit of living in a ‘green’ city as opposed to living near to a park (Formal Recreation Site) or in a ‘green’ neighbourhood (Informal Greenspace) cannot be captured by the methods applied in this paper. This limita- tion is likely to result in an underestimation of the true marginal value of urban ecosystem services.\r\nSecondly, the value functions used are only as good as the original studies they are based\r\nupon. While those studies have been chosen to meet certain standards, they still differ in quality and are limited in scope. Thirdly, there is a fundamental problem in that the methods employed by those original\r\nstudies do not allow us to separate the different categories of value generated by urb greenspaces or to what extent sites are substitutes. This becomes an issue when transferring values from the original study site to other sites as the composition of services and availability of substitutes might differ between the two. Although the set of original studies comprises a quite representative sample ofUKurban green spaces, the inability to condition on greenspace characteristics (apart from size) remains a potentially serious drawback. More extensive, sophisticated and standardised original studies (such as those conducted for different goods by Kirchhoff et al. 1997; Bergstrom and Taylor 2006; Troy andWilson 2006; Eigenbrod et al. 2010) could potentially provide enough detail to allowfor such a disaggregation of benefit categories. Fourthly, as discussed in Davies et al. (2011), standardised data indicating quality or\r\nother features of urban greenspaces is not generally available. Combined with more refined valuation results, such additional detail of the GIS data would greatly enhance the reliability of the benefit transfer method. Last but not least, some of the scenarios (e.g. World Market) imply radical changes in\r\nurban extent, population and greenspace provision. The ability to credibly model the impacts of such major increases in urbanisation based upon existing data is clearly an open empirical question. Consequently, values for such extreme scenarios should be treated with caution and taken as indicative only. Addressing these caveats would clearly form a substantial agenda for future research.\"', NULL, 'No search string and screening criteria mentioned in the paper.', 2, 35),

Altogether, it appears that when it comes to the issue of examining GB drivers, developed countries are in the lead. This can be considered as a call for researchers to undertake more research to examine the GB drivers from the perspectives of different developing countries. Given the rapid urbanization and population growth in many developing countries, it is crucial to fully under- stand how to promote GB to potentially avoid negative impacts that future largescale development may bring upon the environment and human health.

First, we know little about IGS biodiversity out- side of the temperate and humid Cfb, Cfa and Dfb climate zones of Germany, the UK, the USA, and Japan. Future research should tar- get IGS biodiversity in South-East Asia, Africa, South America, the Middle East, India, China, and Australia, as well as IGS in the cli- mate zones A and B. Moreover, international comparisons of IGS are rare, and the lack of studies in many regions limits poten- tial meta-analyses and cross-cultural studies. How do different cultural contexts influence the value of IGS for biodiversity, the possibilities for management adaptions, or the potential for hybrid conservation–recreational use? However, it is important to note that this review only examined the available literature in English, German and Japanese. As discussed above, our search also found Spanish and Russian research papers on IGS. A review of litera- ture on IGS in these languages, Chinese, French, Indonesian, Polish and other languages would likely advance our understanding of IGS and help local planners and IGS owners to adapt policies and management.\r\nSecond, we lack studies on gap, powerline and microsite IGS as well as comprehensive comparative studies. Future research should address this lack of knowledge by examining some of the following questions. How do gap, powerline or microsite IGS contribute to urban biodiversity? How does their potential contri- bution compare to other IGS types? How can management practices\r\nSearch terms used in English, Japanese, and German.\r\nEnglish	Japanese\r\nIGSVariable Ruderal	(arechi) Railway (tetsudo ?)\r\nfor these sites be adapted to benefit conservation? Moving to study designs based on a common IGS typology may help us to identify urban habitats important to biodiversity that researchers might have previously overlooked, and could facilitate studies compar- ing between different IGS types. Research on smaller sites could also redress the paucity of knowledge about IGS in the megacities of Africa and Asia. For instance, it might help to answer questions about whether IGS is meeting food-security needs, such as the har- vesting of spontaneous vegetation or the growing of ‘bush foods’ in the urban interstices, and how in turn this might impact biodiver- sity.\r\nThird, future studies should investigate the role IGS may play for hitherto scarcely studied species groups. Can IGS benefit mammals, reptiles, or marsupials? Do limited size and human disturbance prevent large animals from using IGS? How does the presence of animals in IGS affect resident perception (e.g., opportunities for nature contact, potential for wildlife conflict)? We need to address these three main gaps in our knowledge. Closing these gaps would be a first step to better understanding the local fea- tures of IGS—local features that are key to how IGS contributes to biodiversity, how we should adapt our management of IGS, and how we can integrate IGS into urban conservation strategies. Better knowledge of IGS is crucial for future conservation efforts in urban areas.\r\nFinally, the increasing number of studies on IGS biodiversity pro- vides a growing source of data that future studies could draw upon for meta-analyses. For example, IGS size did not feature promi- nently as a driving factor for species diversity in the papers we examined in our study—despite the important role of this factor in ecological theory (e.g., island biogeography). Future research could analyze a set of IGS studies to explore what role IGS size and related factors such as fragmentation play for the biodiversity of these urban spaces. Another potential target for a meta-analysis would be to quantify (using statistical analysis) the apparent neg- ative relationship between the degree of IGS management and IGS biodiversity—as suggested in some of the literature addressed by this paper. We recognize that this is just one step in a much larger research agenda on IGS. Future studies could address diverse aspects of this understudied component of urban forestry and urban greening.\"', NULL, NULL, NULL, 35),

But guidelines exist and regularly recommend against growing crops less than ten meters from busy roads, particularly in countries where lead-based fuels are still used (Deelstra and Girardet, 2000). Another commonly reported guideline is using buildings and large masses of woody vegetation as barriers between crops and roads as a means of reducing trace metal contamination (Säumel et al., 2012). Proper planning guidelines indicate that when designating an area\r\nas suitable for EGI, that knowledge of past site history, existing soil properties and distance from possible nearby sources of pollution, especially traffic, be taken into account in order to prevent crop contamination. Similarly, the overuse of chemicals needs to be pre- vented (Bretzel et al., 2016). Exceedingly high heavy metal concentra- tions in urban grown fruits and vegetables must be strictly related to specific safe zones in the city where plants are going to be grown. As such, when plants are cultivated near pollution-emission sources (e.g. main roads or factories), risks of heavy metal contamination are increased approximately 1.5-fold when fruits and vegetables are grown 10 m from the road as compared to 60 m (Antisari et al., 2015)...\r\n....We propose that EGI is a rather novel concept that intertwines environmental, social, and economic co-benefits and locates food sources closer to city-dwellers thus increasing food security and lessening food transport distances. It reinforces low-energy and chemi- cal input practices, less human consumption of processed foods, and teaches people from all socioeconomic levels the equitable benefits of locally grown food. An EGI approach can thereby play a vital role in providing city planners and policy makers further justification for green space conservation and utility.

The extensive literature review reveals that even though a lot of work has been reported on green retrofitting, there is still lack of studies on identifying the success factors of implementing green retrofitting in existing buildings. Studies revealed there are barriers, challenges and problems that impede building stakeholders from making green retrofitting decision [52]. Therefore, in view of the limitations of the earlier studies and based on current researches, there is a need to focus future research efforts on the study of success factors of green retrofitting implementation to increase the current retrofitting actions and thus, to mitigate climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.

However, embodied energy figures and, more specifically, life cycle assessment of DSFs should be urgently considered by scholars and practi- tioners alike. This is necessary because a true environmental benefit can only be assessed when the operational energy savings of specific products or technologies are compared with the related embodied energy figures in order to understand the overall performance holistically.\r\n(2) Amongst the operational energy end-uses here considered, lighting and to some extent ventilation are the least consid- ered in literature. While ventilation is very often linked to cooling studies, lighting and more specifically daylighting represent an interesting avenue for further research.\r\n(3) Recently, there has been a growing tendency to apply DSFs in refurbishment, and existing studies cover a broad variation of buildings type.

Such reviews are commonplace in medical research and practice, and have revolutionised the field enabling immense statistical power/confidence in determining the efficacy or treatments or health effects due to exposures. In order to develop high performance, low carbon buildings, the use and application of systematic reviews are being explored to facilitate the uptake of evidence based practices. This is particularly relevant with the growing industry interest in healthy buildings resulting in a merging of health/ built environment fields.\r\nEvidence based (EB) practices are most utilised in the design of healthcare buildings but have limited uptake across other built environment fields. This is resulting in a widening research-practice gap. The introduction of EB practice requires a whole systems change within both academic research and industry practice. Understanding the current attitudes and behaviours within industry and relevant stakeholders is imperative to introduce such change, supported by the Diffusion of Innovation theory and other behavioural science models addressed in this paper.\r\nInitial findings from the establishment of a ‘systematic review’ approach are presented. Authors have identified a number of challenges with their direct implementation into built environment. The key challenge being the multitude of small studies, which makes synthesis of evidence difficult. Built environment studies use varied sample sizes, experimental methods and measured parameters. Furthermore, regional variation in climate and building practice makes comparing results between regions problematic. Many of these features can lead to bias within studies, which a systematic review is typically able to remove when synthesising. In addition, there is pressure for novel approaches, further contributing to this fragmentation and making it difficult to continually build upon the existing evidence base.\r\nApplying the strict assessment criteria of a traditional systematic review to the existing built environment evidence base would eliminate a large volume of possibly valid studies. An alternative evidence review is proposed utilising a ‘realist synthesis’. This approach considers the context around the topic being evaluated and rather than evaluating the rigour of studies based on their design, it considers the value of the findings. Whilst a less rigorous approach than a systematic review, it is more suited to the current state of built environment evidence. The framework for a realist synthesis is presented on which the next stage of this research will be conducted.\"', NULL, NULL, NULL, 35),

Likewise, self-reported measures of desti- nations and design indicated a positive relationship with physical activity.

These results highlight the need for additional hypothesis-driven research based on models linking specific neighbor- hood exposure to health outcomes in older adults. New methods are needed to define “activity spaces”104 that are relevant to older adults and integrate direct mea- surement of these spaces into research.

A systematic review of the literature on the built and biophysical environmental and obesity in youth revealed a small but diverse number of studies representing a broad range of study populations, designs, measures and outcomes. For most of the environmental variables considered, strong empirical evidence is not yet available. Future research should strive for consistency in the types of variables, measures, buffer sizes, control variables used. Further studies should seek to better understand the impact of the qualitative environmental characteristics and consider the joint contributions of available facilities and travel routes to those locations. Also, future studies should attempt to utilize longitudinal, quasi-experimental, and experimental research designs in order to better sort out the direction of causality between environments and obesity outcomes. Lastly, mediators and moderators of the relationship between physical environments and obesity need to be explored (including interactions between different levels of the environment) in order to guide more theoretically-sound and hypothesis-driven research in this area.\"', NULL, NULL, NULL, 35),

These include political leadership and will, market demand and the economics associated with developing a tract of land. It would be naive to think that simply shifting urban planning codes and regulations will be enough to alter entrenched development practices and achieve behavior change. The reality is that these legal and policy modifications are likely to be necessary but not sufficient components of a broader campaign to change the way communities are built and re-developed. With acknowledgement of this complexity, the findings from this review suggest that smart growth planning principles hold promise for promoting physical activity, especially walking. Furthermore, it is suggested that the potential impact of smart growth principles on health could be increased by the systematic inclusion of a health component to community planning.\"', NULL, NULL, NULL, 35),
